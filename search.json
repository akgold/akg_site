    "text": "My first managerial role came by surprise.\nI had just started as a data scientist at a large consulting firm, and my manager was out for my first week with a sprained ankle. I spent that week getting to know the three other folks on the team, thinking I was the new senior data scientist. I was excited to get my hands dirty.\nIt was during my second week that I met with my manager and understood that no, I’d been hired to replace her as the team’s manager.\nFor the next 18 months I stayed in that role, directly managing a team of 4-8 data scientists. That time was a firehose of learning – some were lessons I sought out, and others landed on my head without invitation. I bought many books on management and implemented some of the nuggets I found in those thousands of pages.\nBut I learned even more from some of the big, stupid mistakes I made – including one that literally interrupted my honeymoon on the beaches of Croatia.\nLater, when I joined RStudio, I moved back into an individual contributor role on the Solutions Engineering team. It was around that time I started writing this essay – and I’m now declaring it done, some three years later.\nI’m not a management expert, but I did try really hard during my first year managing and I’ve since spent time digesting the experience. My hope is that others will find a few of the things I learned useful when they’re at the start of their own management journey."

    "text": "My definition of management\nI’ve found management most exciting as a form of leverage. I could only ever type so many lines of code in a day, fit so many models, deploy so many apps. Management was a way to scale myself.\nAs best I can explain it:\n\nGood management is a flywheel generator — it gives the team clarity and helps them feel safe to experiment and grow, resulting in ever-higher levels of collective performance.\n\nReading this clever and finely worded definition fills me with the warm glow of a concept well-encapsulated. But let’s be honest, you — reader — are reading in hopes of being a better manager or, maybe even more likely, understanding why your manager is so bad.\n\nThe philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways. The point, however, is to change it.\n- Karl Marx, Eleven Theses on Feuerbach\n\nIf you’re looking to change the circumstances of your management or managing, this definition is maddeningly vague.\nWhen I started in on all those management books, I figured management would be like other things I had done in my professional life. When I wanted to do machine learning, I’d read some books and then used machine learning techniques on some data.\nBut it turned out management didn’t work like that. It turned out management was a craft.\nAnd like any craft, some theory was helpful, but the hard part was putting that theory into practice."

    "text": "Management was hard\nUnlike data science, where learning more was the answer to a skills gap, my time spent in books didn’t seem to translate directly into being better at my job.\nAs a manager, I found that it wasn’t knowledge I needed, it was the daily practice of doing the work. And in that, I was constantly bumping up against the limits of my bravery and patience.\n\nStay awkward, brave, and kind.\n-Brené Brown\n\nWhen I came back from my honeymoon, I let my ego and my fear of being wrong again get the better of me. I knew that the code and the plots weren’t good enough, and my review could have caught it. I decided that all of the team’s code would be checked into git every night and I would review it.\nThis was a dumb rule – for many reasons.\nThe simplest reason it was dumb was that I’d neglected my first role as a manager – to make the team work well. The people on my team were smart, so this mistake wasn’t an issue of intelligence. Instead, I hadn’t shared enough context about these plots so my team could catch the mistakes themselves.\nShortly after this incident got resolved, I adopted the maxim always provide more context. I found that every minute I put into providing context around why the work was the way it was paid back 10x later on. My team was made up of motivated, smart people, so once they had the necessary context, it was easy for them to spot mistakes or find improvements.\nFor a few weeks after the imposition of my new rules, I found myself in the midst of a howling maelstrom. People were not listening to the new rules, they weren’t doing their work, and they were even threatening to leave for another project.\nAnd I couldn’t figure out why the response had been so extreme. Sure, my rules might be silly, but the response seemed very intense.\nIt gradually dawned on me that I had touched a live wire. People’s work matters to them. It bumps up against the deepest questions they ask themselves about their value and worthiness.\nAnd in my haste to “fix the problem”, I had infantilized the team. And for my team, mostly recent college grads, the intimation that they still might be children after 16+ years of school was about the worst thing I could do.\nEven worse, the new rules were a source of fear. One of the main rules was that code had to be checked into git every night. From my own experience, I knew how hard git is. It is so hard to develop a reliable mental model, and it feels like all the code might go poof with any action.1 And I told my team they had to use it constantly, with no help or guidance from me.\nA big component of the problem was me struggling to manage my own fears and insecurities. I watched my team doing fantastic technical work while I perceived the atrophy of my own technical skills. For me, the challenge was avoiding slipping into defensiveness at that thought. To make it all harder – and I’ve read enough to believe this is true of all managers – I got shockingly little feedback on how I was doing.2\nMostly for worse – but some for better – my commute to this job was quite lengthy, and I listened to this episode of the excellent Start Up Podcast in which someone says the line, “organizations magnify the worst traits of their leaders”. I have seen nothing that makes me think this is anything less than 100% true.\nMy only piece of truly directive advice for any new managers reading this essay:\n\nGo do therapy/counseling.\n\nWe all have traits and quirks that are maladaptive in a management role. Therapy won’t fix them, but it certainly helped me be more aware of my tendencies and patterns, more able to step outside and observe them, and (I hope) reduced the likelihood I unwittingly perpetuated them on my team.\nEventually, once I grasped that the main thing I was actually doing was providing context and managing feelings, and things started going much smoother. Instead of walking into work every day thinking through some technical challenge or another, I tried to activate the best of my bravery and patience for the day ahead and I started digging myself out of the hole I’d fallen in with the team."

    "text": "Management was just a bunch of roles smashed together\nNow that you’re bought into the idea that management can’t really be learned from a book or essay, I’m going to go into my mental model of management.\nIt’s true that a mental model didn’t save me from big mistakes. But it’s also the case that one of my earliest barriers to getting better was not understanding what management was. I didn’t even know what I should be trying to improve.\nHopefully, sharing my mental model can clarify what things you might want to get better at.\nCentral to my mental model of management is that it isn’t actually a role. Manager is a title applied to a collection of largely distinct roles.\nBefore I became a manager, I had heard that management is exhausting because of the amount of context switching required. It turned out for me that this was less about having a calendar packed full of meetings with different people on different topics than it was about having to switch the role I was playing from minute to minute.\n\nA manager’s output = The output of his organization + The output of the neighboring organizations under his influence.\n-Andy Grove, High Output Management\n\nIt felt to me like there were six roles to my job as a manager, from most to least “manager-y”:\n\nAs a people manager, I learned what made my direct reports tick, identified their career aspirations, and pointed out opportunities for progress.\nAs a resource manager, I determined what resources we needed and acquired them. Mostly this meant recruiting, hiring, and onboarding, but it also meant advocating for money for training and team activities.\nAs a project manager, I collected and triaged projects and project requirements, set timetables and schedules, assigned tasks, and had the final say about when work was “done”.\nAs the team’s communications manager, I made sure the team’s work was being shared with the rest of the organization, and that everyone on the team knew what was going on outside.\nAs the process manager, I helped design the team’s processes to make sure we could identify, allot, do, and communicate work across the team.\nAs a technical mentor and coach, I was an expert who reviewed code, answered technical questions, and gave work feedback to my team.\n\nFor the most part, these roles felt pretty distinct from each other, and each of them was a meaningful part of my job.\nIn fact, in recognition of the fact I was working at a consulting firm where people frequently changed projects, my role was explicitly divided between my role as a people (“career”) manager and a “job lead” who managed a particular project and its resources.\nI found that I actually liked this division, as it gave more opportunities to acquire mentors and mentorship. Also, career conversations were truly about career – I wasn’t close enough to the work that status updates made much sense.\nMy technical skills were relevant in many of these roles – but not in the way I had thought. For the most junior employees, my skills outmatched theirs, and I was able to explicitly teach them technical things. But more senior people on the team quickly matched or exceeded my skills.\nThe primary relationship between my data science skills and my skills as a data science manager was that my technical skills helped me ask the right questions. Ultimately, my direct reports succeeded and learned more when they were asked questions than when given answers.\n\nMeetings were my main tool\nMy first, and most obvious, observation about being a manager was that nothing I did was a solo activity. In the work world, any gathering of two or more people is a meeting. Thus, meetings were my main tool as a manager.\nThe meetings varied widely in both form and content. Many were 1-1 meetings between a direct report and, others were team-wide update or decision-making meetings.\nPrimal disdain for meetings is pretty common in tech circles. I believe this is a toxic overreaction to cultures where meetings are all that happens or a result of environments (or people) that undervalue the importance of communication. I came to believe that meetings per se were not the problem.\nInstead, I came to believe meetings are bad when they:\n\nResult in calendar fragmentation.\nFeel useless to attendees.\n\nPreventing calendar fragmentation is a genuinely hard problem. Meetings tend to migrate to places where there are large open blocks of time on people’s calendars. There’s definitely no one-size-fits-all solution, but a focus-time-first orientation to making calendars can help. Aside from that, I found no great solutions here aside from trying to minimize the number of meetings and their size.\nThere have been so many books written on making meetings (feel) useful. Generally, they present a system or tactic to make meetings (feel) useful. Amazon makes everyone read a memo before they start. Tim Ferris won’t show up if there isn’t an agenda ahead of time. 1-1s are supposed to be “the employee’s meeting” where they come with an agenda and get to do most of the talking.\nThey’re fine rules.\nBut I think the focus on tactics often missed the point. Let’s take the example of 1-1 meetings with direct reports, which I found incredibly valuable – even fun!\nUp to the point I became a manager, I didn’t have great experiences with 1-1s. Most of my career didn’t feature formal 1-1s, and the one manager who adopted a real 1-1 playbook managed to make them a potent source of toxicity, format notwithstanding.\nSo, I walked into management really confused about how to do good 1-1s, and deeply skeptical of prescriptive formats.\n\nMy skepticism about meeting formats was later deepened by my first manager at RStudio.\nI loved our 1-1s despite (or because?) he broke every 1-1 rule I’ve ever seen. He talked more than he listened, meandered to wild places, and we never kept an agenda. But each one made me feel valued and seen and I left with clarity about my work. They were amazing.\n\nIn the meetings I ran, I found it was important to make clear why we were there and actually focus on that why in the meeting. Sometimes the tactics from books were helpful…but it constantly varied meeting to meeting and I struggled to taxonomize the meetings or tactics.\nKeeping the focus on what we were there to do never went wrong.\n\nHaving meetings (or parts of meetings) for frivolous fun or to get to know each other is really important – doubly so for remote teams. Just make clear that’s what they’re for!\n\nThe one kind of meeting that is always bad is the group brainstorm with more than about four people. Groups that large don’t do good exploratory thinking. Skip them, write a memo ahead of time, and debate options at the meeting.3"

    "section": "My words carried a lot of power",
    "text": "My words carried a lot of power\nIt’s important to be aware of implicit sources of power in a workplace, like identity-based privilege, technical knowledge, and tenure. Despite being pretty comfortable talking about power and privileged in my life, I was surprised by how much power was still embedded in the explicit management structure of the organization.\nI initially wanted to believe that nothing had changed because I was a manager – I could still be “one of the team”. But it quickly became obvious that my feedback – positive, negative, and even neutral – carried a weight it didn’t before.\nThis shouldn’t have been surprising. I’d had the experience of a manager who would frequently message “have a minute to talk?”. Every single time, my heart jumped into my throat, even though it was usually just to chat about something minor.\nAfter I observed myself doing the same, I tried to always explain why in the same message as a request to meet with a direct report.\nEven more navel-gaze-y, I realized that the form and timing of my communication mattered, because they implicitly set expectations about work habits for others.\nI tried really hard not to send messages outside of work hours – and I made a big deal of visibly unplugging when I went on vacation. I felt those were important norms for our team, and the easiest way to upend them would’ve been to be seen not following them myself.\nIt took me a while to calibrate just how often – and quickly – I had to give feedback.4 I found that critical feedback has a way shorter half-life than I assumed.\nThe first few times I had critical feedback I held it, waiting for a convenient time. But after I’d waited a week, it felt petty to bust out, “Remember that presentation last week? You really should’ve proofread it before we showed a typo to the client.” And I was worried it’d be blown out of proportion in my direct report’s head because it had bothered me enough to hold onto for so long.\nI never delivered that feedback.\nI found the quicker I could give critical feedback, the better – and that the same was also true for positive feedback.\nI don’t have a great anecdote from when I was managing, but a good friend of mine was getting very little feedback at her job. She didn’t really know if she was doing well and didn’t feel like her role was valued in the organization – until the day she resigned.\nSuddenly, accolades were pouring in from leadership across the organization - all the way up to the organization’s head. She was told for the first time that the program she ran made a difference, and that her role was essential. She was personally lauded for the grace, professionalism, and strategic thinking she brought into every meeting.\nIt meant she left feeling good, but what an utter failure of management!"

    "text": "Some challenges I could identify, but couldn’t solve\nAside from the many skills I had to learn and the day-to-day skills I had to develop, some of the roles I inhabited as a manager involved ongoing balancing challenges that I don’t think ever really end.\n\nI was stuck in-between\nOne of the strangest parts of being a first-level manager was how much I felt stuck between the organization above me and the people who worked for me.\nI believe my employer genuinely wanted to treat employees well. They were not trying to – as Jack so eloquently put it on 30 Rock – “squeeze the sweetest juice out of workers’ mind grapes.”\nEven so, I felt a tension between looking out for the company and looking out for my direct reports. In those cases, I generally found it easy to prioritize the people who worked for me. This was especially true since it was many of their first jobs and they hadn’t quite figured out how to advocate for themselves in a workplace.\nThis materialized in simple ways, like with the woman on my team who was a dual citizen. The complexities of having multiple passports and working on projects for the federal government meant she couldn’t visit her parents while she was on the project. It was easy for me to frequently ask whether that was still ok or whether we should start looking for another project.\nBut there were also other cases that were much harder – where there was a tension between my role as a mentor for particular members of my team and my responsibilities to the team as a whole.\nFor example, someone on the team confidentially shared that she was considering another project that would give her more exposure to machine learning. From my perspective as her professional mentor, this was awesome - that was the work she really wanted to do!\nBut it was hard for me to keep this information confidential, because sitting on it meant less time to discuss what to do if she left, and more stress for the rest of the team down the road.\nMy sense is that exactly what you’re stuck between does change depending on the level of management…but I’m not sure this between-ness ever really resolves.\n\n\nResource management was particularly hard\nI despise the use of the term resource to describe a person on a team, like, “we’re going to need to add a resource in Q3” 🤮.\nBut the main resource I managed was the number of people we had and the roles they filled. I found that figuring out the right number of people for our team was an entirely new skill to master.\nBefore I was a manager, I basically just had to figure out how hard to work.\nAs a manager, I gained the mind-bending ability to make more time by adding people. Simultaneously deciding how much work the team could take on and how many people we needed required solving an underdetermined system of equations.\nWith no clear right answer, I had to rely on my judgment about the importance of the marginal bit of work and how quickly we could add team members.\nAnd it wasn’t even that simple! Because I was a stuck-between manager, I couldn’t just decide to add more people or even to spend money on other things like a course or a team dinner – I had to convince several layers of management above me that we needed them.\nDeciding how hard to push – and when - and for what roles – is a challenge that I don’t think ever really ends.\n\n\nMentoring was different\nI knew I was a good data scientist with a particularly strong background in econometrics and statistics, and I had become a very proficient R programmer. I had done a lot of teaching, which I loved. I figured I had the mentoring part of the job in the bag.\nYet again – wrong.\nIt turned out that I was good at teaching and instructing. I was good at clearly explaining technical topics, making them clear and approachable. That was useful.\nBut it turned out that an even bigger part of mentoring as a manager was coaching, rather than teaching. I had to help my direct reports develop an inspiring vision for their career – or at least for their involvement in the current project. It was a heady task – figuring out how to convey really high expectations for people without setting short-term goals or deadlines that were unreasonable.\nMoreover, it was hard to figure out how to balance people’s need for development, letting them slow down and take time to learn, with the need to get stuff done in the quickest way possible. As a manager, it was my responsibility to figure out when we had to focus on efficiency and when there were good opportunities for learning."

    "text": "A PhD is a terrible insurance plan\nIf academia is the only place you’ll be happy working in the future, this essay isn’t for you. The only path to academia is through a PhD program, so fare thee well!\nThat wasn’t me.\nWhen I started grad school, the only thing I knew was that I didn’t want to go into academia. I loved the first two years I worked at Brookings and thought maybe I wanted to go back and do more think tank work. Or go into government. Really, I wanted to work in The West Wing (the TV show where eight people run the entire government, not the physical building as it actually functions).\n\nHere’s a moment that captures why I didn’t want to go into academia.\nI was at a dinner where a professor was discussing his work on the “production technology of education” – aka teaching.\nHe talked about why his work was interesting — new exciting methodological techniques, exciting new data all the time, and plentiful publishing opportunities in general and special-purpose journals.\nNowhere in his extended pitch did he mention that there were opportunities to understand teaching and education to the aim of actually improving teaching and student experience in school.\n🙄\n\nBy the spring of my first year, I’d spent months unhappy with my classes and I knew I was struggling socially and mental health-wise.1 I had even floated the idea of leaving with close friends and family.\nThe exact moment my future PhD went poof was when I spent 15 minutes just to see what my job prospects might look like if I left. In just those few minutes, I found dozens of jobs I wanted that I seemed reasonably qualified for, all of which seemed vastly preferable to another minute in grad school.\nIt struck me that I was getting a PhD as insurance against someday wanting a job for which I needed a PhD.\nI’m delighted at where my career has taken me…and I’ve yet to run into a job where I needed a PhD. At this point, I’m pretty sure it isn’t going to happen. A masters in economics got me my first job after grad school, and as many people will tell you, then it’s just about job experience.\nAn important caveat for me to add: My identity – a cis, straight, white man – has almost certainly has made it easier for me to be perceived as competent even without a PhD. I can’t speak to any other experience because this is the only one I have, but people with marginalized identities may find explicit credentialing more important for opening doors than I have."

    "text": "I was wrong that this was the end of learning\nI am, and have always been, deeply nerdy.\nLearning new things has always brought me great joy, and my assumption was that an economics PhD program would be the Jedi Temple of learning opportunities.\nI didn’t find that to be the case. Instead, I found first year economics classes to be a bizarre and terrible mashup of grueling and boring. I was repeatedly assured that it gets better after first year and much better after finishing classes. I didn’t stay long enough to test that hypothesis.\nBut even in the midst of what felt like the thousandth problem set doing really, really hard 8th grade algebra, I was worried that leaving would mean the end of learning.\nI couldn’t have been more wrong.\nThat’s the big secret of graduate school — it’s not a teaching mechanism, it’s a forcing mechanism. In graduate school you’re forced to spend long (long, long, long) hours a week researching and learning about something new.\nThat’s not a bad thing! I believe strongly in having forcing mechanisms to do important, hard things. But rest assured, if you’re the kind of person who started a PhD and are worried about leaving because you might stop learning, it won’t be a problem.\nI was right that leaving grad school meant the end of a particular kind of school-based learning. It definitely meant the end of knowing – with numeric precision – how my learning compared to others. If you, like me, have always been a good student, the end of grades can be the scariest change of all.\nAnd the shape of professional learning is very different from PhD learning.\nPhD learning is extremely deep, but very narrow. You’ll learn a lot about your discipline and sub-discipline and sub-sub-discipline, but the working world allows (and demands) that you take a broader focus.\nFor some people this is a drawback. For me it was a benefit.\nSince I left grad school, I’ve worked at five different organizations in three different fields (not counting my time as a Segway tour guide). I’ve had to spend a lot of time answering emails, doing busywork, and other things that don’t really promote learning.\nBut I’ve also learned about so many different things, following one to another in a pattern that – at least to me – feels like a random walk of learning cool shit.\nJust to name a few of the different things I’ve been able to explore intellectually: the workings of the American retirement system, machine learning and predictive modeling, data visualization and dashboarding, the mechanics of bond funding for sports stadiums, political advertising, R, Python, and SQL, how servers and networking work, and business leadership and management.\nSome of these things I could’ve learned in a classroom.\nBut a lot, I couldn’t. I learned how to operate in an organization — how to figure out how to get things done in the face of institutional inertia. I’ve learned how small, medium, and very, very large institutions try to implement changes.\nAll to say — I have not stopped learning since I left grad school.\nNot for a minute."

    "text": "I care that my work matters\nAn unprovable claim that I nonetheless completely believe: getting a PhD in 2020 is harder and less rewarding than it might’ve been in 1920 or 1970, because the amount of codified prior knowledge is so much greater.\nThis means that you’ve got to learn more to get to cool new stuff and that specialization is narrower and contributions are smaller.2\nBy the time you get to a dissertation topic, there are probably only a handful of people who are deep enough to actually care about your topic.\nIn many fields, academic writing involves a relatively small handful of people writing on a topic, citing each other, piling counterargument atop counterargument in successive papers, and devoted to a tiny slice of the field. In fact, there are reasonable estimates that no one ever cites 32% of articles in the Social Sciences. The percentage is higher in the humanities.\nI found the thought that basically no one would care about my work deeply frustrating.\nJust the other day (now several years ago), I had a client say that their hospital system was already looking into opening new clinics based on market research my team had done. I thought that was cool, and a great change of pace compared to dreaming of a few people someday reading the tome I’d written."

    "text": "I work best on teams\nMany people work best in teams. I certainly do.\nMy greatest joy in grad school was the little study group I managed to find. By the end of the year, each of us was capable of high-fidelity recreations of the others’ Chewbacca-like cries of anguish when a proof turned out to be faulty.\nBut in the years since I left, that group scattered. After first year, people split into different specialty classes in second year and then into different specialties and eventually to writing their dissertations solo.\nMost academics are teams of one, and though many papers are co-authored these days, dissertations generally are not.\nI definitely do my best work getting to talk through a problem with my peers — I’m an out-loud thinker. Though it’s mostly supposition on my part, I think I would’ve really struggled with how much I could bring to my advisor to discuss and how much I just had to puzzle out on my own.\nOn the contrary, I’ve never worked on anything but a team since leaving grad school.\nMost non-academic teams are highly multidisciplinary, because they have to be. While you might be the only person with your particular skills on the team, you’ll probably be in league with a half-dozen other people who add important domain knowledge, technical know-how, or management skills to the team."

    "text": "I love teaching, coaching, and mentoring\nI knew I didn’t want to be a research academic, but I did love teaching.\nI thought, “maybe I do want to become a college professor, the teaching kind.” I’d had some professors in college who were such astoundingly good teachers that I thought maybe I wanted to do the same (looking at you, Mary-Jane Rubenstein and Gil Skillman).\nI thought that staying in an academic setting was my best opportunity to get to keep teaching and mentoring. I had no real understanding that teaching and mentoring could happen in a professional context.3\n\nAnd I had some REALLY bad teaching in grad school.\nThe most gobsmacking moment of my PhD program was when our professor told us that everyone had missed a question on an exam – and that the problem was our exam preparation.\nEvery single student had missed a question on his exam.\nEvery single bright-eyed PhD first year and overachieving Masters student had missed a question — and that it was our fault for not studying right.\nAt the risk of killing the point by over-explaining it, every entering PhD students has a little bit of Chidi from The Good Place in them — a little entranced by a future of offices brimming with books they’ve actually ready, long walks full of deep discussion with brilliant coworkers, and dreams of discovering something new about the world every day.\nThe notion that he had taught us the material and that we’d just studied wrong was so ridiculous that I am still shocked it was said aloud a decade on.\n\nI won’t say that I’ve never encountered bad or toxic management since leaving grad school. I have.\nBut if you like coaching, teaching, and mentoring, there are so many incredible opportunities to do that outside academia.\nAnd from what I hear, teaching in academia ain’t so hot these days.\nIt’s true, I’ve never gotten to didactically lecture a class, cloud of chalk blooming as I deliver a brilliant lecture. But I get to develop deep relationships with my colleagues and occasionally help them figure out a thing or two about a topic I really like.\nIt has been wonderful. In fact, I like it so much that after a few years of technical work I’m now full-time “in management”. I love it. So much so that I started and finished an essay about my first year managing a data science team in the time it took me just to polish this one."

It might seem like grad school is a no-risk path. You’re probably right.\nThere are people who like - or love – grad school. You lucked out with an advisor who’s awesome and friends who you love. In that case, your opportunity cost is low. Yes, you probably could be earning more money by leaving, but life is about so much more than that.\nOn the other hand, if you – like me – find yourself miserable every single day of grad school, I’d encourage you to think hard about leaving. There are almost certainly other paths that you can find equally rewarding – intellectually, financially, and spiritually.\nI was incredibly lucky. When I raised the idea of leaving with my parents and my girlfriend, they were open to the idea that I should drop out and happy to expend emotional energy talking about it for the nearly six months it took me to decide.\nYou may not be so lucky.\nIf you need a little push, tweet at me. I’m always happy to tell someone that they, yes they, should drop out."

    "text": "Wired: Team’s enthusiasm for learning R\nTired: How much R they already know\nThis is pretty straightforward. By far the most important factor that will determine your team’s success in transitioning to R is whether they’re excited about it, and the least important is how much they already know. Learning R just really isn’t that hard. People who are excited to learn will do it, and those who aren’t won’t. It’s that simple.\nDon’t know who’s excited and who’s not? Ask them! And don’t just ask whether they’re excited to learn R. What you really want to know is whether they’re excited to work on a team that operates with R at its core. Transitioning to R from Excel or Stata has a bunch of potential benefits. Making those benefits real requires a lot more than just writing some code. It’s a wholesale transition in terms of how the team thinks about work (see future blog posts for more on that)."

    "text": "Lesser Angels\nBeyond enthusiasm, there are a couple of things you can do to make it easier, whether you’re a team member or the leader.\n\nTidyverse-First Orientation: If you’ve been doing R for a while, you probably know this, but the Tidyverse is AWESOME. It takes the wonderful benefits of R and adds an opinionated take on what code should look like. If you’re just learning R, start with the Tidyverse. You’ll be glad you did because it’s magical.1\nRelentless R: Adoping R as a team isn’t really about a programming langauge, it’s organizational change. Writing code is easy. Changing hearts, minds, and workflows is hard. There are people who make whole careers out of this stuff. Don’t get down if it’s slow going. I’m skeptical it’s possible to really transition a team to R in less than 12 months.\nLearning Environment: More on this during Tip #2: Failure, but you’re trying to make room for people to learn. That means it’s important to make work a space where they won’t feel stupid for asking questions or making mistakes. Hopefully this is already true for your workplace…but it’s especially important if you’re trying to get your team to do something new and hard like use R. Every workplace is busy, but almost every one can spare an hour a week to do a mini-seminar on R, or to share a package of the week. On my team, we have a show-and-tell every Friday where people share something they’ve learned. Very often, that something is a fun new R thing!\n\nA sub-point to this: If you can, don’t expect that all this learning will take place outside of work. Some people on your team may have kids or parents they’re caring for, or other life circumstances that mean that they have less capacity to do out-of-work learning than others. They can still be amazing partners on your journey to R. If you’re the team lead, try and make space for them to learn. If not, make sure they’re included on at-work R plans."

I believed I could go off, write a package, and deliver it from on high a la Moses from Mount Sinai.1\nI’ve come to call the result of this (not so great) pattern the Wizard Package.\nWizard Packages can work. I’ve seen Wizard Packages work when (1) the whole team is clear that a package will solve the problem, (2) the need is can be met by clever R code, and (3) the team is strongly motivated to adopt the package.\nIn my case, none of these conditions held. I wasn’t riding a wave of enthusiasm for R – I was trying to spark it. People weren’t super motivated to adopt the package, and I couldn’t really compel them to do so. Worst of all, my R code just wasn’t solving the keenest problems of my teammates.\nBecause they’re written by R wizards, Wizard Packages tend to solve R wizard problems. They have clever wrappers for other functions, or convenience functions for advanced R users.\nVery often though, the team’s needs aren’t needs that are solved primarily by clever R code – the team needs to get their R Markdown report formatted with the right CSS, or calculate correct standard errors from a complicated estimator, or complete those weird database merges that only one person on the team knows how to do.2\nWizard packages convey expertise of a sort, but they often aren’t adopted because they’re not expert enough, or aren’t expert in the right ways."

By collecting that knowledge directly, you can incorporate someone’s data vis, database access, or stats expertise without needing them to write R code.\nWriting documentation, tests, or vignettes Internal packages often include documentation or vignettes that go beyond just explaining the functions themselves, but providing some context on why the function works as it does.

    "text": "When I first went to data conferences, I assumed that EVERYONE else was pulling data from a supercomputer-backed Spark cluster, immaculately maintained by an army of data engineers. Needless to say, that was not my data infrastructure.\nTo be more succinct, most of the “data infrastructure” I’ve worked with has just been csv files. And our ETL processes – cleaning csv files to output more csv files (or rds).\nBased on my very informal polling of people in the field, this is WAY more common than anyone admits, especially if you’re on a team that’s just upgrading to R. As you make that switch, it’s easy to be discouraged feeling like everyone else is lightyears ahead. The (not so) dirty secret is that they’re not really.\nIf I had to guess, the modal data scientist/analyst working in industry does ETL across a mixture of flat files and SQL databases. It’s still relatively rare to find people working on higher-power systems.1\nComing into a new role and discovering that you’re expected to wrangle a bunch of csv files can be frustrating, especially if you don’t reall ywant to be a data engineer. But you should. The number one way to be a better data scientist is to become the data engineer you wish you had.\nBeing a great junior data scientist is 75% just knowing the data super well. A junior data scientist who can confidently identify things that just look weird in data is worth approximately 47 XGBoost models and 76 convolutional neural nets.\nA data scientist who combines data science knowledge with expertise on the data’s provenance and the data-generating process is way more likely to make a good catch or identify a clever new feature for modeling than a better modeler with little understanding of the specifics of the data.\nSo yes, become the data engineer for your data because you need it, but also to make yourself a better data scientist. It won’t kill you."

    "text": "Upgrading to R\nSo many data scientists have had the same experience - walking onto a team where something other than R or Python was the language of choice. Unless that other language was Julia or Scala, this was almost certainly a disappointing moment. But it doesn’t have a be a reason to run screaming for the hills.\nI’ve now worked on several teams that have successfully transitioned from Excel or Stata to R. These transitions, while sometimes painful, were definitely worth it. Along the way, I learned a few tips and made a lot of mistakes. I decided I’d try to share as much as possible to help anyone else in the same boat. These lessons will be particularly applicable to someone leading a data science team that’s transitioning. Some will also be relevant if you’re a junior staffer trying to push change, but not all.\nIn thinking about the transitions I’ve been part of, here are tips that might’ve helped me if I’d known them when I started. Links will be added as the posts go live.\nEdit: I seem to have fallen behind on these; maybe I’ll finish someday…"

There was a remarkable variety in what the speakers covered – from deep thoughts on the ethics and philosophy of doing data science, to some super useful RStudio tips and tricks and everything in between. I decided to take my notes from the two days and post below in case there’s things anyone else might find useful.\nOne of the remarkable similarities between the speakers was the degree to which many talks focused on process of doing data science. It feels like there’s a lot of room for growth in terms of understanding and standardizing best practices of doing data science."

    "text": "Deep Thoughts\nMany of the speakers shared some great nuggets of insight into doing data science that extended far beyond simple lessons about R. Some of my favorites below.\n\nThe Past, Present, and Future of Data Science\n\nStatistics has gradually added different parts of the statistical process to the field — but many process points remain to be integrated. We don’t have a theory of a good statistical workflow. Meta-systematization is needed. We need to systematize how we systematize things.\nWhy do we need theory? Theory is scalable. Simulations are not.\nWe should be specifying priors about effect sizes along with research designs.\nIs having a core data science team at a company a good thing or a bad thing?\nThe history of software engineering is a great guide for the future of data science.\nAs data gets bigger, machine learning problems and questions will get bigger too. Our jobs are safe.\nThe hardest job of a data scientist is turning open-ended problems in the real world into practical problem statements that are solvable using data. Defining success is essential.\nSoftware engineers build and grow software — the sky is the limit. Data scientists are scientists and are constrained by the real world.\n\n\n\nData Science as Business Intelligence (and Empathy)\n\nAnalysis doesn’t end at result delivery — it ends at developing and proselytizing new business strategies and innovation.\nAutomating Excel workflows can be a first step towards bringing R to a team.\nAgile development tells user stories as an empathy hack.\n\n\nAs a ______\nI want ______\nSo I can ______ \n\nPerson-level stories (the near) are always more meaningful than data stories (the far). We need to balance both as Data Scientists.\nIn development, we need to have an actual user in mind, rather than a theoretical user who wants everything.\n\n\n\nHow to Live-Tweet an Event (a great aside)\n\nThree important elements in live tweet of event: conference hashtag #rstatsnyc, @speaker (put . first so it’s viewable publicly), always include a pic.\nThey can have one of a few purposes: intro person/topic, spread insight, link to resource, spread positivity!\n\nLive tweet: conference hashtag, @speaker, picture, positivity \n\n\nHow to Hackathon\n\nIf you’re not at risk of failing a few days a quarter, you’re not pushing.\nKeys to focused hacking: rock solid infrastrure, minimize context switching (away messages), parallel work, strong and clear conversation, timeline accountability (detailed to the half-hour), positive team dynamic, time-boxing decisions.\nHow to start an analysis:\n\nIdentify assumptions about a solution\nRank assumptions by how critical they are\nTest assumptions with the simplest experiment possible\n\nFail fast. The worst thing about spending a few months barking up the wrong tree isn’t the time or money lost — it’s team demoralization.\nTruths about data science:\n\nNerd != won’t engage with business\nShiny tool != hard problem\nShiny tool != being a smart data scientist\n\n\n\n\nOpen Source and Package-Building\n\nThe hardest step in joining the open source community is going from 0 contributions to 1.\nOpen source contributions: failing test with fix &gt; failing test &gt; bug report\n\nRemember to include sessionInfo()\n\nPackage release ideas:\n\nRelease quickly, but also slowly — take time to fix dumb decisions\nBlaze new trails, but don’t reinvent the wheel\nTell people about your package — then listen.\n\nPackage design: documentation &gt; usability &gt; performance &gt; features"

There’s also a jobs list and an api.\nIt is possible to predict which officers in police departments will have adverse incidents with the public in order to arrange interventions. Nashville and Charlottesville are doing this. This work can save lives.\nROpenSci does peer review for R packages. Many of their packages get data from scientific databases or interface with scientific equipment."
