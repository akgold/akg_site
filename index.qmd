# Major Writing Projects

## [Essay: Managing the First Year](/mfy.html)

An essay about the (many) lessons I learned in my first year of managing a data science team.

## [📕🏗DevOps 4 Data Science🏗📕](https://akgold.github.io/do4ds/)

An book on lessons for Data Scientists from DevOps, how to manage your own server-based data science platform, and how to work with IT at your organization.

Very much a work in progress. Expected completion of rough draft: June 2022.
