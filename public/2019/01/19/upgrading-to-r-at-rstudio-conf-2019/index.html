<p>A few months ago, I was beyond thrilled to be chosen to give an e-poster at RStudio::conf(2019) on the topic of <em>Upgrading to R</em>. I had such a blast talking to people who are trying to get their team to use more R, sharing some of the lessons I&rsquo;ve learned over the last few years. My slides are available <a href="https://akgold.github.io/rsconf2019/">online</a>, but I&rsquo;d also like to share some of the things I spoke with people about, and a little on how I made the slides.</p>

<h2 id="upgrading-to-r">Upgrading to R</h2>

<p>So many data scientists have had the same experience - walking onto a team where something other than R or Python was the language of choice. Unless that other language was Julia or Scala, this was almost certainly a disappointing moment. But it doesn&rsquo;t have a be a reason to run screaming for the hills.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve now worked on several teams that have successfully transitioned from Excel or Stata to R. These transitions, while sometimes painful, were definitely worth it. Along the way, I learned a few tips and made a lot of mistakes. I decided I&rsquo;d try to share as much as possible to help anyone else in the same boat. These lessons will be particularly applicable to someone <em>leading</em> a data science team that&rsquo;s transitioning. Some will also be relevant if you&rsquo;re a junior staffer trying to push change, but not all.</p>

<p>In thinking about the transitions I&rsquo;ve been part of, here are tips that might&rsquo;ve helped me if I&rsquo;d known them when I started. Links will be added as the posts go live.</p>
