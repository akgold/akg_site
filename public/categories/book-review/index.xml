      <description>The Bottom Line: 3&amp;frasl;5 stars
Seven Pillars of Statistical Wisdom by Stephen Stigler purports to share seven of the most central insights in the history of statistics, what they mean, and why they were revolutionary when first introduced. The book sometimes reaches this lofty ambition, but often sags under the weight of that challenge. Despite the unevenness, it&amp;rsquo;s definitely worth a read for statisticians and data scientists alike.1
Stigler sets forth the Seven Pillars (Aggregation, Information Measurement, Likelihood, Intercomparison, Regression, Experimental Design, and Residual) as deep truths in modern statistical thinking.</description>

      <description>The Bottom Line: 2&amp;frasl;5 stars
Who reads books on the history of statistics that doesn&amp;rsquo;t already have significant familiarity with statistics&amp;hellip;or at least interest in gaining it? If someone could answer that question for me, I think I&amp;rsquo;d understand better why David Salsburg wrote The Lady Tasting Tea: How Statistics Revolutionized Science in the Twentieth Century.
Lady Tasting Tea purports to tell the story of the Kuhnian paradigm shift in science where our understanding of the universe shifted from that of a complicated clock to the lens randomness and probability that pervades modern scientific and popular thought.</description>
