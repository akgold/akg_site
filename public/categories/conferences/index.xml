      <description>This is the first in a series of posts sharing some insights on upgrading to R. See the index post for others.
Walking on to an R-less team on the first day is a daunting experience, made all the more so by not knowing whether youâ€™ve got the right people. In my experience, there are a few factors that can help drive the team from here (a sadly R-less land) to the magical place where free range R code runs all day, the data is always clean, and syntax errors are nonexistent.</description>

      <description>A few months ago, I was beyond thrilled to be chosen to give an e-poster at RStudio::conf(2019) on the topic of Upgrading to R. I had such a blast talking to people who are trying to get their team to use more R, sharing some of the lessons I&amp;rsquo;ve learned over the last few years. My slides are available online, but I&amp;rsquo;d also like to share some of the things I spoke with people about, and a little on how I made the slides.</description>
