      <description>If you, like me, work primarily in R, I bet you&amp;rsquo;ve pulled a colleague&amp;rsquo;s scripts, tried to load the data and, File Not Found Error.
Argh!!
Thanks to Jenny Bryan&amp;rsquo;s awesome blog post, I learned there&amp;rsquo;s a better solution that&amp;rsquo;s already made me overhaul my sharing workflow.
Thanks to the combination of RStudio Projects in RStudio and the here package, my woes with manually setting directories are over.
For a while, I&amp;rsquo;ve been using RStudio Projects since they&amp;rsquo;re a great way to keep work on different projects distinct.</description>

      <description>The rvest package is awesome. No surprise there, it&amp;rsquo;s a Hadley Wickham jont. I&amp;rsquo;m in the early stages of a small project looking at goodreads quotes. I think I&amp;rsquo;m going to try to predict popular quotes. Then maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll build a neural network to generate quotes trained on these. Stay tuned.
Anyway, I wanted to extract the top quotes on goodreads, and rvest made it super easy! I&amp;rsquo;d suggest this tutorial for anyone just getting started.</description>
