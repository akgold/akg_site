      <description>A few months ago, I was beyond thrilled to be chosen to give an e-poster at RStudio::conf(2019) on the topic of Upgrading to R. I had such a blast talking to people who are trying to get their team to use more R, sharing some of the lessons I&amp;rsquo;ve learned over the last few years. My slides are available online, but I&amp;rsquo;d also like to share some of the things I spoke with people about, and a little on how I made the slides.</description>

      <description>If you, like me, work primarily in R, I bet you&amp;rsquo;ve pulled a colleague&amp;rsquo;s scripts, tried to load the data and, File Not Found Error.
Argh!!
Thanks to Jenny Bryan&amp;rsquo;s awesome blog post, I learned there&amp;rsquo;s a better solution that&amp;rsquo;s already made me overhaul my sharing workflow.
Thanks to the combination of RStudio Projects in RStudio and the here package, my woes with manually setting directories are over.
For a while, I&amp;rsquo;ve been using RStudio Projects since they&amp;rsquo;re a great way to keep work on different projects distinct.</description>

      <title>Fonts in ggplot2 on Windows and Mac</title>

      <description>A lot of things are great and easy to do in ggplot2&amp;hellip;but putting new fonts in can be a pain in the butt. I had to do this last week, so I decided to write down what I did (as much for me as for anyone else).
 Get the package extrafont: install.packages(&#39;extrafont&#39;) Start extrafont: library(extrafont) Import system fonts to R (this can take a minute): font_import() Load fonts: loadfonts(device = &#39;win&#39;).</description>
