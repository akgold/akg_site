      <description>I decided yesterday that I was going to create a little shiny app for my wife. I won’t share the details here because it’s mushy, but suffice it to say the idea is that she can go to a website and get some nice notes I left for her.

 Since I wanted to serve this site for cheap, I was going to run a shiny server on an EC2 instance that fit into AWS’s free tier.</description>
