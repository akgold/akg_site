      <description>If you, like me have a pretty solid background in statistics and matrix algebra but don&amp;rsquo;t know much about deep learning or neural networks, I highly recommend the ebook Neural Networks and Deep Learning by Michael Nielsen.
The Ebook The book is mostly focused on the math and mechanics of deep learning, as opposed to building and using neural networks in a production context. It&amp;rsquo;s a really excellent introduction to what a neural network is and how they learn.</description>
