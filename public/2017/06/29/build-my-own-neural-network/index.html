<p>If you, like me have a pretty solid background in statistics and matrix algebra but don&rsquo;t know much about deep learning or neural networks, I <strong>highly</strong> recommend the ebook <a href="http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/">Neural Networks and Deep Learning</a> by Michael Nielsen.</p>

<h1 id="the-ebook">The Ebook</h1>

<p>The book is mostly focused on the math and mechanics of deep learning, as opposed to building and using neural networks in a production context. It&rsquo;s a really excellent introduction to what a neural network is and how they learn. It&rsquo;s a great blend of intuition and enough math to be able to get a good handle on what the intuition means in practice (intuition doesn&rsquo;t mean much until you can connect it to the math in my mind).</p>

<p>Though the math technically doesn&rsquo;t get any more complicated than some multivariable calculus, I think those with a pretty solid understanding of predictive analytics and inferential statistics would find themselves better served. I, for one, was delighted to find that I basically understood the intuition behind how neural networks learned because I already understand maximum likelihood estimation.</p>

<h1 id="building-my-own">Building My Own</h1>

<p>In the book, Nielsen builds a simple neural network for digit recognition using the popular <a href="http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/">mnist</a> dataset from scratch in Python. I decided that to make sure I really understood what was going on, I would do the same in R.</p>

<p>You can see my R code <a href="https://github.com/akgold/neural-networks-and-deep-learning/blob/master/network_1.R">here</a>. I&rsquo;m proud to say that it runs. I&rsquo;m less proud to say that it doesn&rsquo;t actully work. It&rsquo;s also pretty ugly&hellip;</p>

<p>I messed up something in the math of the backpropagation. To be honest, I learned a ton from getting as far as I did, and debugging it the rest of the way doesn&rsquo;t seem like a good use of my time. Instead, I&rsquo;m turning to learning about production deep learning packages like Keras and Tensor Flow. More on those soon!</p>
