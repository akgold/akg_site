<p>I decided yesterday that I was going to create a little <a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com/">shiny</a> app for my wife. I won’t share the details here because it’s mushy, but suffice it to say the idea is that she can go to a website and get some nice notes I left for her.</p>

<p>Since I wanted to serve this site for cheap, I was going to run a <code>shiny</code> server on an EC2 instance that fit into AWS’s free tier. The finished product will run just fine on this tiny server, but I was finding that package installation was taking forever.</p>
<p>After launching the AWS instance and installing R, I ran <code>install.packages(&quot;dplyr&quot;)</code> and walked away, knowing that it might take a minute on such a puny system. 25 minutes and 47 seconds later, it was still compiling the <code>mutate</code> command.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

</div>
<p>I knew installing packages from binary (i.e. pre-compiled) would be way faster. That was validated when the <code>dplyr</code> installation that didn’t finish in 25 minutes and 47 seconds installed from binary in about 10 seconds.</p>

<p>There are a bunch of warnings for using binary packages, particularly that they are community-maintained, are likely to not be up-to date with the latest source updates, and are not available for all package/OS combos. In particular, if you’re looking for an enterprise solution, <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/package-manager/">RStudio’s Package Manager</a> is perfect for this sort of thing (did I mention I’m starting work there a week from Monday?).</p>
<p>BUT - if you’re trying to spend zero money to do something cute for your wife, this will work.</p>
<div id="add-repository-for-binaries" class="section level3">
<h3>Add Repository for Binaries</h3>
<p>Since we’re installing binaries here, you’ll be installing them using your system’s installer (e.g. <code>apt-get</code> in Ubuntu ), not <code>install.packages()</code> in R. Therefore you’ve got to tell Ubuntu that it can install from the binaries online.</p>
<p>Once you find the right combo of R version (looks like 3.4.x and 3.5.x are supported right now) and OS on the <a href="https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/">r-project</a> website, you add it to your system’s list of sources (using command line, not in an R terminal) and update the repos:</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>echo &quot;deb [allow-insecure=yes] https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu bionic/&quot; | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list
sudo apt-get update</code></pre>
<p>Note the little <code>[allow-insecure=yes]</code> decorator. This allows for packages to be installed even if they’re not verified. I had some issues with this piece, and since I trust the <code>r-project</code> folks, I thought it was ok to allow here.</p>
</div>
<div id="off-to-the-races" class="section level3">
<h3>Off to the Races</h3>
<p>That’s really it in terms of setup. Now you can search for available R package binaries, for example</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>apt search dplyr</code></pre>
<p>And install them in seconds, like</p>
<pre class="bash"><code>sudo apt-get install r-cran-dplyr</code></pre>
<p>Done! Packages installed in record time. Mushiness managed.</p>
