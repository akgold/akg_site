I decided yesterday that I was going to create a little [shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) app for my wife. I won't share the details here because it's mushy, but suffice it to say the idea is that she can go to a website and get some nice notes I left for her.

Since I was trying to stick with the AWS free tier, I was installing on a tiny machine. The finished product will run just fine on this tiny server, but I was finding that package installation was taking forever. 

After launching the AWS instance and installing R, I ran `install.packages("dplyr")` and walked away, knowing that it might take a minute on such a puny system. 25 minutes and 47 seconds later (a length of time, strangely enough, exactly equal to the length of one [Star Wars Rebels](https://www.starwars.com/tv-shows/star-wars-rebels) episode...), it was still compiling the `mutate` command.

When I eventually got it working, that `dplyr` installation that didn't finish in 25 minutes and 47 seconds was done in about 10 seconds.

There are a bunch of warnings for using compiled packages, particularly that they are community-maintained, are likely to not be up-to date with the latest source updates, and are not available for all package/OS combos. In particular, if you're looking for an enterprise solution, [RStudio's Package Manager](https://www.rstudio.com/products/package-manager/) is perfect for this sort of thing (did I mention I'm starting work there a week from Monday?).

BUT - if you're trying to spend zero money to do something cute for your wife, this will work.

### Add Repository for Binaries
Since we're installing binaries here, you'll be installing them using your system's installer (e.g. `apt-get` in Ubuntu ), not `install.packages()` in R. Therefore you've got to tell Ubuntu that it can install from the binaries online.

Once you find the right combo of R version (looks like 3.4.x and 3.5.x are supported right now) and OS on the [r-project](https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/) website, you can use the command line to add it to your system's list of sources (command line, not in an R terminal):

```{bash, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
echo "deb [allow-insecure=yes] https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu bionic/" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list
```

Note the little `[allow-insecure=yes]` decorator. This allows for packages to be installed even if they're not verified. I had some issues with this piece, and since you trust the `r-project` folks, it's ok to allow here.

Then you'll update the list of allowable installs using 

```{bash, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
sudo apt-get update
```

And voila! Now you can search for available R package binaries, for example

```{bash, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
apt search dplyr
```

And install them in seconds, like
```{bash, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
sudo apt-get install r-cran-dplyr
```

Done! Packages installed in record time. Mushiness managed.
