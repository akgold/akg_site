      "contents": "\nI became a manager for the first time by surprise.\nI had been hired to be a “data scientist” for the first time, after years of doing data science work with different titles. During my first week, I spoke to my manager only once on the phone, as she was out of work with a sprained ankle. So I spent the week getting to know the team, thinking I was coming in as a senior data scientist.\nIt was only in my second week, as I spoke with my manager more that I understood that no, I’d been hired to replace her as the team’s manager.\nDuring the 18 months I stayed in that role, I learned a ton about management. I read thousands of pages on management and made some really big, stupid, mistakes – including one that literally interrupted my honeymoon on the beaches of Croatia.\nI started this writing project just after I left my management role, when I moved back into individual contributor work when I came to RStudio. As of this writing in early March 2021, I find myself in the early stages of moving back into management at RStudio. Writing something like this is nerve wracking.\nSo it’s worth saying up front – I’m not an expert on management. I’m sure I’ll have even more mistakes to write about after the next 18 months of managing. That said, I learned a lot during my first year that I’m sure will help this time around, and I’m hopeful that others might find a few of the things I learned useful on their own management journey.\nManaging The First Year\nWhen I realized I was going to be a manager, I was excited about the challenge, but also sure I didn’t know how to manage, and wasn’t really even sure about how to learn. I understood that leading a data science team was different from doing data science, and that it would demand I develop new skills.\nEven so, I don’t think I could have anticipated how much managing would stretch me as a professional and a person.\nWhen I started, I wasn’t sure how to learn to manage…or even what management really was. I’d had a few good managers over the years (and some bad ones), but didn’t have a clear mental model of what management was or how I could get good at it. Certainly nobody was knocking down my door to mentor me in management skills, and no one was going to hire a Trillion Dollar Coach for a first year junior manager.\nSo I did what I do best — I turned to books. I read management books, biographies of managers, deep dives on companies that seemed to have figured something great out.\nRecommendations on my favorites at the bottom\nI’m proud of the work the team did during the 18 months I managed them. We produced a lot of valuable data analysis, and moved a lot of work into R and Python (yay reproducibility!) that had been done in Excel and Tableau.\nI’m proudest not of any particular deliverable, but of building a team culture where collaborative problem solving was the very highest value – I remember the first time I talked to a direct report who had consulted a colleague and solved a thorny visualization problem in Tableau while I was busy doing other things.\nAs someone who loves data science, that switch was the hardest. As a manager, my relationship to our data science work was mostly secondhand. My primary responsibility was not the output, but the team itself.\nWhat is “Management”?\nGood management is a flywheel generator — it clears obstacles to IC achievement, creates an environment of safety and growth, and finds and aggregates resources the team needs.\nNumerous resources refer to the roles of the manager with the 3 Ps:\n\nPeople - are team members happy and engaged?\nProcess - are there mechanisms for the team to be jointly productive?\nPriorities - is there a shared vision of the work to be done?\n\nI’ve always found the three Ps a little pat. Yes, they basically summarize what a manager does…but I think, like so many management concepts, they don’t actually help make anyone good at them.\nAlso, the way you engage with each of these really differs depending on the level of manager you are. Being CEO of a 10,000 person company is really different than managing 5 data scientists. Here’s more on my experience of actually managing a small team.\nTo me, the job of a junior manager has four distinct parts — which are sometimes literally divided into different roles in some workplaces:\n\nProject manager Responsibility for collecting project requirements and needs, setting timetables and schedules, assigning tasks, and coordinating and communicating among project stakeholders.\nPeople manager Responsibility for the day-to-day performance of subordinates, as well as their long-term career trajectory.\nResources manager Responsible for marshaling resources — most often people and their time to join the team and their projects. Often involving hiring and firing and determining roles.\nProcess Manager Responsible for creating and designing processes to accomplish all the rest. On many teams, this responsibility is spread out among many individuals, some of whom are “managers”, some of whom are not.\n\nThe question is how being good at your IC work affects the management tasks ahead of you. The path absolutely is not linear. It is not the case that being good at your job makes you a good manager.\nIf you’re a highly skilled IC, you’ll probably be better than others at understanding what has to happen in terms of collecting requirements and setting schedules, and you might be better at mentoring and coaching if you’re doing direct teaching.\nSome people believe the opposite to be true — being too good at IC work makes you less able to coach people who aren’t such naturals. I’m somewhat skeptical of this claim. I’ve seen too many people who are both amazing ICs and teachers and coaches (particularly in martial arts) to believe this is true.\nSo why would you want to do this if you really excel at IC work? To me, the most compelling reason is to gain leverage. Leverage is the ability to get a lot from a little. In Silicon Valley, they love to throw around the idea of a 10x developer — that is a developer so genius and prolific they are literally 10 times as productive as most others. Let’s take this idea seriously just for a second. Let’s say you’re a 10x developer, then you could plausibly replace 10 people with yourself. So if you manage 11 people, you’ve now exceeded your own personal output, and let’s be real — you’re not a 10x developer (because they don’t exist).\nDon’t manage 11 people directly. In my experience, the maximum number anyone can reasonably manage directly is somewhere between 7-9. Fewer is definitely better, but I’ve seen a 10th direct report crush the best managers.\nAnd now, my most important piece of management advice\n\nEvery manager should do therapy/counseling.\n\nBeing a manager will bring out and magnify your insecurities, fears, and misguided thoughts, and they WILL be visited on your direct reports. I can’t remember where, but I once heard that “organizations magnify the worst traits of their leaders”.^[I think it might’ve been this episode of the EXCELLENT Start Up Podcast.] I have seen nothing that makes me think this is anything less than 100% true.\nWe all have traits and quirks that are maladaptive in a management role. Therapy won’t fix them, but it can increase awareness of them, and reduce the likelihood you’ll unwittingly perpetuate them upon your team.\nI do believe there is one big distinguishing feature between people who excel in a management role and those who struggle — they have a theory for why people (usually based on their own experience — as an example or counter-example) are good at their job. They might not use that language — but they’ve thought about why they’re good at what they do.\nThis thinking is the raw material of good managing. Turning it into actual good management requires intentionally, willpower, and a lot of generosity. What it does not require is any sort of “natural inclination” — beyond the desire to do those things.\nI should also say there are occasionally amazing leaders who are great leaders simply because they are so personally astounding and don’t do any of the things I describe here. I am not one of those people and you probably aren’t either. If you are, I’m shocked you started reading this. Either way, kudos and stop reading — you do you.\nMentorship and Coaching\nMentorship and coaching can be a big part of managing, and one of the most rewarding.\nWho am I? There are many different identities that you’ll have to manage between yourself and your direct reports. I always found that I struggled to convey expectations as high as I have for myself to my direct reports. I excused slow work and responded kindly to weak excuses for poor outcomes.\nI definitely fell victim to trying to be too much of a friend and not enough of a coach. Meanwhile, there is also the role of managing tasks vs career mentorship. There are many times where the demands of the immediate task is in conflict with the career wishes of the direct reports. For example, we had projects that really needed to get done — my direct reports wanted to learn the technology we were using, but what we really needed was for them to just get it done. How do you balance the time they need to develop new skills with the requirement that they do the actual work ahead.\n(Care personally vs challenge directly)\nManaging New Workers/Interns\nExtra challenges\nWhose interests do I represent?\nThis is a surprisingly difficult question. As a manager, you have two ways to look — up, and down. Looking up, you have responsibilities to the company, your bosses, the rules and regulations (and potentially laws) that govern the way you work. But you also have to look down to your responsibilities to the people you manage.\nUnlike looking up, where the entities involved are somewhat amorphous and impersonal, looking down to the people you manage involves their real concerns. For example, I was on a consulting project that required a Public Trust — the lowest level of clearance possible in the federal clearance process. However, one of my colleagues was as dual citizen, and was forced to give up her other passport in order to get her Public Trust. Unfortunately that meant that she couldn’t go home to visit her parents, as her home country required that dual citizens travel there only with their passport.\nThese issues become intensely personal.\nBe aware of the fact that if you’re mentoring younger people in particular, they probably don’t understand the dynamic of a workplace and that they have to protect themselves from their employer. As a high school food service employee, I once purchased and brought home a pizza on which I’d messed up the order, because I thought I had to — and I have a severe dairy allergy.\nIn very real terms of power and privilege, the people who work for you almost certainly need more protecting from the company than the company needs protecting from them.\nAdditionally, people know when your number one priority is looking out for them and they will respond in kind.\nMeetings\nAre really useful. They’re your primary tool as a manager.\nDIsdain for meetings in is toxic.\nThey can get out of hand, but just be mindful. Do a meeting Marie Kondo periodically.\n1:1s\nAre essential How to do them well?\nTeam Meetings\nAlso essential\nEasier to push on barbell than broomstick (group brainstorming = :vomit:)\nAbout Setting and Communicating Goals and Priorities\nRequesting Resources (More people!)\nOne of primary jobs of manager. Easy to overlook when you’re not used to thinking of team size as something under your control.\nManager: scope, scale, and personnel are mutable\nBook Recommendations\nThese are not necessarily the best books on management, but ones that I found useful. There are a lot of bad ones. This list is in order.\nRadical Candor\nHigh Output Management\nMythical Man Month\n\n\n\n",
