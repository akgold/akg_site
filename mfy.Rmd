I became a manager for the first time by surprise.

I had been hired to be a "data scientist" for the first time, after
years of doing data science work with different titles. During my first
week, I spoke to my manager only once on the phone, as she was out of
work with a sprained ankle. So I spent the week getting to know the
team, thinking I was coming in as a senior data scientist.

It was only in my second week, as I spoke with my manager more that I
understood that no, I'd been hired to replace her **as** the team's
manager.

During the 18 months I stayed in that role, I learned a ton about
management. I read thousands of pages on management and made some really
big, stupid, mistakes -- including one that literally interrupted my
honeymoon on the beaches of Croatia.

I started this writing project just after I left my management role,
when I moved back into individual contributor (IC) work when I came to
RStudio. As of this writing in early March 2021, I find myself in the
early stages of moving back into management at RStudio.

So it's worth saying up front -- I'm not an expert on management and
putting this out into the world is a little petrifying. I'm sure I more
big, stupid mistakes to write about 18 months from now. That said, my
first year managing taught me many lessons that I'm sure will help, and
maybe others will find a few of the things I learned useful on their own
management journey.

# Managing the first year

I was on my honeymoon in the old town of Split, Croatia, known for its
old-world charm and stunning azure waters. My new wife and I were
staying in a tiny walk-up flat. The most remarkable feature of this
single-room apartment was the bathroom, which was enclosed solely with a
glass wall, privacy provided solely by gauzy purple curtain.

And though we were close enough to the beach to hear the seagulls
caw-ing out the window, I was hunched over in the unlit stairwell of the
building, listening to my voicemails and reading emails about the
managerial crisis that was unfolding back at home.

One of my direct reports had made some fairly substantial mistakes in a
set of charts that had gone to a client. Mistakes that reflected that
we, the supposed data experts, had no idea what was actually going on in
the data.

At the time, I was around 9 months into my tenure as a new manager,
managing a team that had grown from 3 to 6 analysts and data scientists,
providing analytics and data science support to a large federal contract
at our consulting firm.

As soon as I'd realized that I was going to be thrust into the world of
management, I'd started trying to figure out how to learn. I knew that
leading a data science team was going to be very different from doing
data science, demanding new kinds of work and new skills of me.

But, I wasn't sure how to learn to manage...or even what management
really was...or how to learn.

I'd had a few good managers over the years (and some bad ones), but
didn't have a clear mental model of what management was or how I could
get good at it. Certainly nobody was knocking down my door to mentor me
in management skills, and no one was going to hire a [Trillion Dollar
Coach](https://www.trilliondollarcoach.com/) for a first year junior
manager.

So I did what I do best --- I turned to books. I read management books,
biographies of managers, deep dives on companies that seemed to have
figured something great out.

<aside>

Recommendations on my favorites at [the bottom](#book-recs).

</aside>

Most of those books were bad (or at least over-long by half), but some
were good. I developed a reasonably coherent mental model of what
managing is.

And yet -- I was still crouched in a stairway, on my honeymoon, seagulls
beckoning, listening to voicemails about data values being too big by
half and categories not making sense.

I write all this to share that having a theory of good management has
been important to me, but it was wildly insufficient.

> *Management is more craft than art or science. Like any craft the
> trick is in the doing*.

So, I hope you'll get some helpful mental models out of this (partially
finished) essay -- but even the best mental models are only modest
protection against ending up in a dark stairway, listening the seagulls,
wishing the line plots would just go away.

# What is "management"?

For many people skilled in IC work, management seems like an
unattractive land. An colorless flatland filled with meeting after
meeting -- and none of the creative joy of IC work. In my experience, it
is true that you'll probably do less of the IC work you know and love if
you move into management.

I was challenged in ways I wasn't prepared for, especially emotionally.
Being a manager was a huge challenge, and when I went to RStudio and
back to IC work I jumped at the chance -- because in some ways, the
hardest IC work feels like a vacation after the emotional stretching of
being a manager.

On the other hand, I found more joy in watching my team succeed than I
ever had from seeing a model run successfully or a dashboard light up a
client's face. Seeing the people on my team achieve higher levels of
success and independence was an enormous reward -- and I elected to move
back into management as soon as I was given an opportunity.

Aside from the feel-goody-ness of management, management is most
exciting as a form of leverage (in the financial sense). You can only
ever type so many lines of code in a day, fit so many models, deploy so
many apps. But if you can scale yourself -- figure out how to share and
spread some of your expertise. That's a truly special thing to be able
to do.

As best I can explain it:

> Good management is a flywheel generator --- it clears obstacles to
> achievement of individual contributors (ICs), creates an environment
> of safety and growth, finds and aggregates resources the team needs,
> and ensures that everyone understands what the team is doing.

Reading this clever and finely-worded definition fills me with the warm
glow of a concept well-encapsulated. But let's be honest, you --- reader
--- are reading in hopes of **being a better manager**, or maybe even
more likely, understanding why your manager is so bad.

<aside>

*The philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways. The
point, however, is to change it.*

\- Karl Marx, Eleven Theses on Feuerbach\

</aside>

If you're looking to change the circumstances of your management or
managing, this definition is maddeningly vague. That's largely because
the term *management* covers such a broad range of activities that it's
somewhat meaningless.

My experience was at the most junior level of management -- directly
managing a team of 4-8 data scientists.[^1] I'm sure that my day-to-day
work shared some activities with the CEO of the company, some 7 levels
in the hierarchy up from me, but I bet not a lot.

[^1]: Often called *line* management, for reasons that almost certainly
    hearken back to the assembly line...

I'm proud of the work the team did during the 18 months I managed them.
We produced a lot of valuable data analysis, and moved a lot of work
into R and Python (yay reproducibility!) that had been done in Excel and
Tableau.

<aside>

There are so many variants on language around who is managed and who is
manager. **Manager** and **direct report** strike me as the best of a
bunch of bad options to describe that curious relationship.

</aside>

One curious aspect of that time is the the inverse relationship between
my level of pride and my level of personal involvement in the output.
The weeks after the honeymoon interruption, when I tried to do the work
of the whole team have a dark cloud above them, while the time I talked
to a direct report who had consulted a colleague and solved a thorny
visualization problem while I was busy doing other things glows in my
memory.

## Roles of a manager

I have no direct experience with anything other than the most junior
levels of management, so I'm going to stick to what I actually know. As
a first-level (line) manager, my work mostly fell into five mostly
disjoint roles:

> -   **The project manager** collects and triages project requirements,
>     sets timetables and schedules, assigns tasks, and is responsible
>     for communications with stakeholders outside the team.
> -   **The people manager** pays attention to the happiness and
>     well-being of direct reports, stays in touch with their long-term
>     career aspirations, and provides thought partnership about how to
>     get there.
> -   **The resources manager** determines the resources --- usually
>     people and their time --- required for the team and its work,
>     hiring, onboarding, and firing people.
> -   **The process manager** Responsible for creating and designing
>     processes to accomplish all the rest. On many teams, this
>     responsibility is spread out among many individuals, some of whom
>     are "managers", some of whom are not.
> -   **The communications manager** makes sure the team's work is being
>     promoted to those outside and ensures a shared vision across those
>     on the team.

For me, resources management was the hardest. As an IC, the amount of
work is more-or-less fixed, and the choice variable is how hard you
work/on what. As a manager, the work content, amount, level of burn the
team is under, are all choice variables.

As the people you manage get more senior, the first of these to drop
away is the project management. With more senior people, you just help
guide people and trust them to do more of their own direct project
management.

One thing that was entirely apparent was that my prowess as an IC
mattered only to the extent it made me credible at these other things.

If you're a highly skilled IC, you'll probably be better than others at
understanding what has to happen in terms of collecting requirements and
setting schedules, and you might be better at mentoring and coaching if
you're doing direct teaching.

Some people believe the opposite to be true --- being too good at IC
work makes you less able to coach people who aren't such naturals. I'm
somewhat skeptical of this claim. I've seen too many people who are both
amazing ICs and teachers and coaches (particularly in martial arts) to
believe this is true.

I do believe there is one big distinguishing feature between people who
excel in a management role and those who struggle --- they have a theory
for why people (usually based on their own experience --- as an example
or counter-example) are good at their job. They might not use that
language --- but they've thought about why they're good at what they do.

This thinking is the raw material of good managing. Turning it into
actual good management requires intentionally, willpower, and a lot of
generosity. What it does not require is any sort of "natural
inclination" --- beyond the desire to do those things.

I should also say there are occasionally amazing leaders who are great
leaders simply because they are so personally astounding and don't do
any of the things I describe here. I am not one of those people and you
probably aren't either. If you are, I'm shocked you started reading
this. Either way, kudos and stop reading --- you do you.

### Managing is all about feelings

As a manager, you'll spend a good bit of time managing your direct
reports' feelings and concerns. But first, it's really important to
address your own.

Being a manager will bring out and magnify all your insecurities, fears,
and misguided thoughts. You'll get shockingly little feedback from
anyone on how you're doing. And worst of all, this will all be visited
on your direct reports.

The quote that sticks in my head is that "organizations magnify the
worst traits of their leaders".[^2] I have seen nothing that makes me
think this is anything less than 100% true.

[^2]: I *think* it was [this
    episode](https://gimletmedia.com/shows/startup/mehw5w/gimlet-23-shadowed-qualities)
    of the excellent Start Up Podcast.

So my only piece of truly directive advice for managers:

> Every manager should do therapy/counseling.

We all have traits and quirks that are maladaptive in a management role.
Therapy won't *fix* them, but it can increase awareness of them, and
reduce the likelihood you'll unwittingly perpetuate them upon your team.

### Respect the power you've got

One thing that's important to be aware of as you enter management is the
extra weight your words now carry. Feedback -- positive, negative, and
even neutral carries a weight it didn't when you were just an IC.

If you're anything like me, getting a message from my manager saying
"have a minute to talk?" makes your heart race a little, while the same
message from someone at the same seniority as me elicits no reaction.

Generally trying to be aware of the impact of your words and actions is
an imporatnt part of management. As a manager you implicitly and
explicitly set norms throughout organizations.

One important role you have as a manager is to give feedback. In many
cases, new managers fixate on having to give negative feedback as a hard
part of their new job. But you also have to give positive feedback.
Someone I know got almost no positive feedback at her job -- until the
day she quit. Suddenly the accolades came pouring out of the woodwork
from her manager and more senior leadership -- all the way up to the
head of the organization. The program she ran was impactful, and her
role essential. She's brought grace, professionalism, and strategic
thinking to the organization.

What an utter failure of management. Managing isn't like a funeral. You
don't save up the nice things to say to someone until they're gone. You
want to give feedback -- both positive and negative -- **as quickly as
possible**.[^3] If not, you risk waiting too long to give feedback.

[^3]: The section on feedback in [Radical Candor](#book-recs)
    particularly influenced my thinking on this front.

Negative feedback, in particular, has a half-life. If you have minor
negative feedback -- "you really needed to spellcheck those slides
before the presentation" -- saving it for later makes it either seem
petty to bring up and you'll skip it, or it'll blow it out of proportion
to the person you're delivering it to "my behavior was so bad that it
was worth bringing up 2 weeks later?!?".

When someone does something great -- tell them immediately -- and
publicly if possible. When someone does something that requires
correction, tell them immediately, and privately.

Aside from actually giving feedback to your reports, you also set norms
with your actions. A huge -- often overlooked -- example of this is your
work habits. Send emails and messages outside of work hours? Your direct
reports will see and respond. On the other hand, visibly unplug when you
go on vacation -- that is a powerful norm -- one you should feel honored
to uphold.

## Mentorship and Coaching

Mentorship and coaching can be a big part of managing, and one of the
most rewarding.

Who am I? There are many different identities that you'll have to manage
between yourself and your direct reports. I always found that I
struggled to convey expectations as high as I have for myself to my
direct reports. I excused slow work and responded kindly to weak excuses
for poor outcomes.

I definitely fell victim to trying to be too much of a *friend* and not
enough of a *coach*. Meanwhile, there is also the role of managing tasks
vs career mentorship. There are many times where the demands of the
immediate task is in conflict with the career wishes of the direct
reports. For example, we had projects that really needed to get done ---
my direct reports wanted to learn the technology we were using, but what
we really needed was for them to just get it done. How do you balance
the time they need to develop new skills with the requirement that they
do the actual work ahead.

(Care personally vs challenge directly)

What is a direct report? How does the langauge matter?

## Managing New Workers/Interns

Extra challenges

## Balancing Autonomy For Direct Reports

Still hard, harder for younger workers.

### Whose interests do I represent?

This is a surprisingly difficult question. As a manager, you have two
ways to look --- up, and down. Looking up, you have responsibilities to
the company, your bosses, the rules and regulations (and potentially
laws) that govern the way you work. But you also have to look down to
your responsibilities to the people you manage.

Unlike looking up, where the entities involved are somewhat amorphous
and impersonal, looking down to the people you manage involves their
real concerns. For example, I was on a consulting project that required
a Public Trust --- the lowest level of clearance possible in the federal
clearance process. However, one of my colleagues was as dual citizen,
and was forced to give up her other passport in order to get her Public
Trust. Unfortunately that meant that she couldn't go home to visit her
parents, as her home country required that dual citizens travel there
only with their passport.

These issues become intensely personal.

Be aware of the fact that if you're mentoring younger people in
particular, they probably don't understand the dynamic of a workplace
and that they have to protect themselves from their employer. As a high
school food service employee, I once purchased and brought home a pizza
on which I'd messed up the order, because I thought I had to --- and I
have a severe dairy allergy.

In very real terms of power and privilege, the people who work for you
almost certainly need more protecting from the company than the company
needs protecting from them.

Additionally, people know when your number one priority is looking out
for them and they will respond in kind.

# Book Recommendations {#book-recs}

I've read many, many books on management. I think most are not terribly
useful -- often providing 3 pages of insight in 150 pages of text, or
providing a mix of theory and practice that ends up being insufficiently
useful on both dimensions.[^4]

[^4]: I am keenly aware of the danger of speaking ill of others writing,
    given my own limitations as a writer. But if it can be useful to
    you, maybe it's worth it.

I'm not going to badmouth any particular books, but I've read most of
the currently-popular management books. So if it's not on this list,
I've probably read it and don't think it was worth the time.

Your mileage may vary.

### Theory

These books strongly shaped the way I think about what management is and
what a manager is doing.

You'll notice that I lean towards older books on theory -- both of these
recommendations were written before I was born! While the computer,
internet, and emote work have changed the practice of management, I
don't think the underlying theory has changed at all.

I strongly believe that the core messages of these books are still fresh
and important, but I will note that some of the commentary and
assumptions, especially around gender, have not aged well.

**High Output Management (1983)**

Andy Groves' classic on what management is and how to measure a manager.
Light on practical advice, amazing for forming a mental model of
management.

**Mythical Man Month (1975)**

Fred Brooks' tome on communicating across large groups and software
complexity. Not strictly about management, but deeply impacted the way I
think about the optimal size of working groups and how to help people be
productive.

### Practice

This book helped me figure out what to do every day as a manager,
providing concrete advice on how to do onboarding with people you're
newly managing, conduct 1:1s, and more.

**Radical Candor (2017)**

Kim Scott's book on how to provide direct and meaningful feedback to
direct reports across a wide range of topics and venues. As a new
manager, providing feedback was one of the strangest and hardest things
to learn.
