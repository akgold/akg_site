I first became a manager by surprise.

During my first week at a consulting firm supporting a large federal
client, my manager was out, so I spent the week getting to know 3 other
analysts and data scientists on the team. I was excited to join as the
team's most senior data scientist and to get my hands dirty.

It was during my second week that I understood that no, I'd been hired
to replace her **as** the team's manager.

For the next 18 months I stayed in that role, directly managing a team
of 4-8 data scientists. That time was a firehose of learning -- some
lessons I had sought out, and others than landed on my head without
invitation. I bought many books on management and implemented some of
the nuggets I found in those thousands of pages.

But I learned even more from some of the big, stupid, mistakes I made --
including one that literally interrupted my honeymoon on the beaches of
Croatia.

After that role, I moved back into an individual contributor role on the
Solutions Engineering team at RStudio. Around the time I changed jobs, I
started this writing project.

I'm not a management expert, but I did try really hard during my first
year managing, and I've since spent time digesting the experience. My
hope is that others will find a few of the things I learned useful when
they're at the start of their own management journey.

# Managing the first year

When I first understood that I was to manage this team, I knew it would
be very different from doing data science, demanding new kinds of work
and new skills of me. But I didn't know how to do it yet, and to be
honest, I didn't really know what management was.

The next 18 months were an incredible challenge. Even with the
overwhelming amount I had to learn when I first started as a Solutions
Engineer at RStudio, it felt like vacation after the daily emotional
reaching management had required of me.

As I started, I really didn't have a clear idea of what management was.
I'd had a few good managers over the years (and more bad ones), but
didn't really understand why the good ones had been good and the bad
ones bad.

So I did what I do best --- I turned to books. I read management books,
biographies of managers, deep dives on companies that seemed to have
figured something great out.

<aside>

Recommendations on my favorites at [the bottom](#book-recs).

</aside>

Most of those books were bad (or at least over-long by half), but some
were good. I developed a reasonably coherent mental model of what
managing is.

And yet -- I found myself on my honeymoon in Split, Croatia, known for
its old-world charm and stunning azure waters. My new wife and I were
staying in a single-room flat so humorously small that the bathroom was
just a glass-enclosed corner of the room, privacy provided solely gauzy
purple curtain.

But I was crouched in the dark stairwell listening to voicemails and
reading emails.

We had delivered charts to a client during my honeymoon. Charts that
included impossible data values, labels that made no sense, and
misclassified of data points. The mistakes reflected that we, the
supposed data experts, had no idea what the data was -- much less any
cogent interpretation.

Clearly I had goofed -- the person who had created the charts didn't
have the context and knowledge necessary to produce the charts without
error.

And then things got worse after I got home and instituted drastic new
requirements for everyone's code to be checked in and reviewed daily.
Many on the team chafed under the sudden new requirements, and a few
weeks after that, I found myself in a number of difficult conversations
about how we might lose people on the team, all due to my actions.

But the team recovered. Over the remainder of my time there, the team
more-than-doubled in size, and by the time I left for RStudio, I believe
it was a reasonably highly-functional data and analytics team.

And I loved it.

For some skilled individual contributors, management can seem like an
unattractive place to be. An endless flatland of meeting after meeting
-- and none of the creative challenge of IC work. That was not my
experience.

While I enjoyed getting things done on my own, it paled in comparison to
the joy of watching my team succeed. And I found management to be
incredibly creative -- dreaming up how to structure our team and our
work processes required as much ingenuity as anything I'd done as a data
scientist.

So, I hope you'll get some helpful mental models out of this essay --
but even the best mental models are only modest protection against
ending up in a dark stairway, listening the seagulls, wishing you'd
never even heard of line plots or line management.

## My definition of management

Aside from the feel-goody-ness of management, I've found management most
exciting as a form of leverage. I could only ever type so many lines of
code in a day, fit so many models, deploy so many apps. Management was a
way to scale myself.

As best I can explain it:

> Good management is a flywheel generator --- it gives the team clarity
> and helps them feel safe to to experiment and grow.

Reading this clever and finely-worded definition fills me with the warm
glow of a concept well-encapsulated. But let's be honest, you --- reader
--- are reading in hopes of **being a better manager**, or maybe even
more likely, understanding why your manager is so bad.

<aside>

*The philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways. The
point, however, is to change it.*

\- Karl Marx, Eleven Theses on Feuerbach

</aside>

If you're looking to change the circumstances of your management or
managing, this definition is maddeningly vague.

When I started in on all those management books, I figured management
would be like other things I had done in my professional life. When I
wanted to do machine learning, I'd read some books and then used machine
learning techniques on some data.

But it turned out management didn't work like that. It turned out
**management was a craft**.

And like any craft, some theory was helpful, but the hard part was
putting that theory into practice.

## Management was hard

Unlike data science, where a skills gap could be rectified by learning
more, getting better at management required conquering things much
deeper than not knowing enough about particular machine learning
techniques.

As a manager, I constantly found myself constantly bumping up against
the limits of my own bravery and patience.

<aside>

*Stay awkward, brave, and kind.*

</aside>

\
Mostly for worse -- but some for better -- my commute to this job was
quite lengthy, and I listened to [this
episode](https://gimletmedia.com/shows/startup/mehw5w/gimlet-23-shadowed-qualities)
of the excellent Start Up Podcast in which someone says the line,
"organizations magnify the worst traits of their leaders". I have seen
nothing that makes me think this is anything less than 100% true.

So my only piece of truly directive advice for any new managers reading
this book:

> Go do therapy/counseling.

We all have traits and quirks that are maladaptive in a management role.
Therapy won't *fix* them, but it certainly helped me be more aware of my
tendencies and patterns, more able to step outside and observe them, and
(I hope) reduced the likelihood I unwittingly perpetuated them on my
team.

When I came back from my honeymoon, I thought I knew what had gone
wrong. The code and the plots weren't good enough, and my review could
catch it in the future. So I decided that all code the team wrote would
be checked into git every night and I would review it.

This was a dumb rule -- for many reasons.

The simplest reason it was dumb was that I'd neglected my first role as
a manager -- to make the **team** work well. The people on my team were
smart, so this mistake wasn't an issue of intelligence. Instead, I
hadn't shared enough context about the particular interpretation what
these plots were or what the values meant so they could be intelligible.

Shortly after this incident got resolved, I adopted the maxim **always
provide more context**. I found that every minute I put into providing
context around why something was happening was paid back in spades later
on. My team was made up of really motivated, really smart people, so
once they had the necessary context, it was easy for them to spot
mistakes or find improvements that made sense.

It was fine once resolved, but for a few weeks after the imposition of
my new rules, I found myself in the midst of a howling maelstrom. People
were not listening to the new rules, they weren't doing their work, and
they were even threatening to leave for another project.

For a while, I couldn't figure out why the response had been so extreme.
Sure, my rules were maybe silly, but the response seemed very intense.

It gradually dawned on my that I had explicit responsibility for the
daily work and careers of the people on my team. People's work matters
to them. It bumps up against the deepest questions they ask themselves
about their value and worthiness.

And as a manager, I was suddenly bumping up against these feelings and
questions on a daily basis.

Meanwhile, I was having to manage my own fears and insecurities. I
watched my team doing fantastic technical work while I perceived the
atrophy of my own technical skills. For me, the challenge was avoiding
slipping into defensiveness at that thought. To make it all harder --
and I've read enough to believe this is true of all managers -- I got
shockingly little feedback on how I was doing.[^1]

[^1]: There are some great strategies to create an environment where
    team members can give feedback to team leaders. These are really
    important...but it's pretty hard to get there, and as a manager I
    was flying blind most of the time.

It took me a while to understand how much my stupid rule had
disrespected my team and struck at fears they held -- and being
disrespected and afraid always provokes extreme responses.

My new rules were infantilizing. They didn't respect the professionalism
of the people on my team. And for my team, mostly relatively recent
college grads, the intimation that they'd gotten all the way through 16
years of school and still couldn't *do* anything was a pretty extreme
form of disrespect.

Moreover, the new rules provoked the fear of being stupid or lacking.
Most of my team wasn't terribly comfortable with git -- and git is a
particularly fearful beast. I found it very hard to develop a reliable
mental model, and I felt like I was always moments away from destroying
all my work.[^2]

[^2]: If you or your team is trying to learn git, I strongly recommend
    [Happy Git with R](https://happygitwithr.com/) as a resource. Good
    luck, git is super awesome once you get it, but it's a doozy.

Once I grasped that the main thing I was actually doing was providing
context and managing feelings, things started going much smoother.
Instead of walking into work every day thinking through some technical
challenge or another, I tried to activate the best of my bravery and
patience for the day ahead.

## Management was just a bunch of roles smashed together

Now please allow me to completely contradict myself.

While most of the hardness of management was in bringing my best self to
understand what my direct reports needed, one of the earliest barriers
to getting better was that I didn't understand what management was. I
didn't know what roles I was expected to inhabit or what the skills were
that I needed to improve.

This section is about my mental model of what management is.

Central to my mental model of management is that it isn't actually a
role. Manager is a title applied to a constellation of roles that I
found to be mostly distinct.

One of the reasons management is exhausting is the amount of context
switching required. This felt like it was as much about switching the
role I was playing from minute to minute as having a calendar packed
full of meetings with different people on different topics.

<aside>

*A manager's output = The output of his organization + The output of the
neighboring organizations under his influence.*

-Andy Grove, High Output Management

</aside>

It felt to me like there were six roles to my job as a manager, starting
from the most "manager-y":

-   As a **people manager,** I learned what made my direct reports tick,
    identified their career aspirations, and pointed out opportunities
    for progress.

-   As a **resource manager**, I determined what resources we needed and
    acquired them. Mostly this meant recruiting, hiring, and onboarding,
    but it also meant advocating for money for training and team
    activities.

-   As a **project manager**, I collected and triaged projects and
    project requirements, set timetables and schedules, assigned tasks,
    and had the final say about when work was "done".

-   As the team's **communications manager**, I made sure the team's
    work was being shared with the rest of the organization, and that
    everyone on the team knew what was going on outside.

-   As the **process manager**, I helped design the team's processes to
    make sure we could identify, allot, do, and communicate work across
    the team.

-   As a **technical mentor and coach**, I was a technical expert who
    reviewed code, answered technical questions, and gave work feedback
    to my team.

For the most part, these roles felt pretty distinct from each other, and
each of them was a meaningful part of my job.

In fact, in recognition of the fact I was working at a consulting firm
where people frequently changed projects, my role was explicitly divided
between my role as a people ("career") manager and a "job lead" who
managed a particular project and its resources. I actually really liked
this division, as if gave my direct reports opportunities to acquire
more mentors and mentorship.

My technical skills were relevant in many of these roles -- but not in
the way I had thought. For the most junior employees, my skills
outmatched theirs, and I was able to explicitly teach them technical
things. But more senior people on the team quickly matched or exceeded
my skills.

The primary relationship between my data science skills and my skills as
a data science manager was that my technical skills helped me **ask the
right questions**. Ultimately, my direct reports succeeded and learned
more when they were asked questions than given answers.

### Meetings were my main main tool

My first, and most obvious, observation about being a manager was that
nothing I did was a solo activity. In the work world, any gathering of
two or more people is a meeting. Thus, meetings were my main tool as a
manager.

My meetings varied widely in both form and content. Many were 1-1
meetings between me and a direct report, others were team-wide update or
decision-making meetings.

Primal disdain for meetings is pretty common in tech circles. I believe
this is a toxic overreaction to cultures where meetings are all that
happens or a result of environments (or people) that undervalue the
importance of communication. I came to believe that meetings *per se*
were not the problem.

Instead, I came to believe meetings are bad when they:

1.  Result in calendar fragmentation.

2.  Feel useless to attendees.

Preventing calendar fragmentation is a genuinely hard problem. Meetings
tend to migrate to places where there are large open blocks of time on
people's calendars. There's definitely no one-size-fits-all solution,
but a focus-time-first orientation to making calendars can help. Aside
from that, I found no great solutions here aside from trying to minimize
the number of meetings and their size.

There have been so many books written on making meetings (feel) useful.
Generally they present a system or tactic to make meetings (feel)
useful. Amazon makes everyone read a memo before they start. Tim Ferris
won't show up if there isn't an agenda ahead of time. 1-1s are supposed
to be "the employee's meeting" where they come with an agenda and get to
do most of the talking. They're fine rules.

But I think the focus on tactics often missed the point. Let's take the
example of 1-1 meetings with direct reports, which I found incredibly
valuable -- even fun!

Up to the point I became a manager, I didn't have great experiences with
1-1s. Most of my career didn't feature formal 1-1s, and the one manager
who adopted a real 1-1 playbook managed to make them quite negative even
with a set format.

So I walked into management really confused about how to do good 1-1s,
and deeply skeptical of prescriptive formats.

<aside>

My skepticism about meeting formats was later deepened by my first
manager at RStudio.

I loved our 1-1s. Each one made me feel valued and seen and I left with
clarity about my work, this despite (or because?) him breaking every 1-1
rule I've ever seen.

</aside>

I found it was important to make clear *why we were there* and actually
focus on that why in the meeting. Sometimes the tactics from books were
helpful...but it constantly varied meeting to meeting and I struggled to
taxonomize the meetings or tactics.

Keeping the focus on what we were there to do never went wrong.

<aside>

Having meetings (or parts of meetings) for frivolous fun or to get to
know each other is really important -- doubly so for remote teams.

</aside>

The one kind of meeting that is *always bad* is the group brainstorm
with more than about 4 people. Groups that large don't do good
exploratory thinking. Skip them, write a memo ahead of time, and debate
options at the meeting.[^3]

[^3]: Writing is also an important tool as a manager. I've found writing
    really useful for me to work out my thoughts on something -- or to
    get feedback from particular people. I've generally found it less
    useful as a way to convey information.

    Makes you wonder who this essay is really for...

## My words carried a lot of power

It's important to be aware of implicit sources of power in a workplace
like identity-based privilege, technical knowledge, and tenure. Despite
being pretty comfortable talking about power and privileged in my life,
I was surprised by how much power was still embedded in the explicit
management structure of the organization.

I initially wanted to believe that nothing had changed because I was a
manager -- I could still be "one of the team". But it quickly became
obvious that my feedback -- positive, negative, and even neutral --
carried a weight it didn't before.

This shouldn't have been surprising. I'd had the experience of a manager
who would frequently message "have a minute to talk?". Every single
time, my heart jumped into my throat, even though it was usually just to
chat about something minor.

After I observed myself doing the same, I tried to always explain why in
the same message as a request to meet with a direct report.

Even more complicated, I came to feel that the form and timing of my
communication mattered, because they communicated about my work habits,
which implicitly set expectations for others.

I tried really hard not to send messages outside of work hours -- and I
made a big deal of visibly unplugging when I went on vacation. I felt
those were important norms for our team, and the easiest way to upend
them would've been to be seen not following them myself.

Another new thing was how often -- and quickly -- I had to give
feedback.[^4] I quickly found that critical feedback, has a short
half-life. The first few times I had critical feedback, I held onto it,
figuring I'd deliver it at a more convenient time.

[^4]: The section on feedback in [Radical Candor](#book-recs)
    particularly influenced my thinking on this front.

But if I'd waited a week, it felt petty to bust out, "Remember that
presentation last week? You really should've proofread it before we
showed a typo to the client." And when it didn't feel petty, I was
worried it'd be blown out of proportion in my direct reports' head
because it had bothered me enough to hold onto for so long. I found the
quicker I could give critical feedback, the better.

I also found that speed was important for positive feedback.

I don't have a great anecdote from when I was managing, but a good
friend of mine was getting very little feedback at her job. She didn't
really know if she was doing well, and didn't feel like her role was
valued in the organization -- until the day she resigned.

Suddenly, accolades were pouring in from leadership across the
organization - all the way up to the organization's head. She was told
*for the first time* that the program she ran made a difference, and
that her role was essential. She was personally lauded for the grace,
professionalism, and strategic thinking she brought into every meeting.

It meant she left feeling good, but what an utter failure of management!

## Some challenges I could identify, but couldn't solve

Aside from the many skills I had to learn and the day-to-day skills I
had to develop, some of the roles I inhabited as a manager involved
ongoing balancing challenges that I don't think ever really end.

### I was stuck in-between

One of the strangest parts of being a first-level manager was how much I
felt stuck between the organization above me and the people who worked
for me.

I believe my employer genuinely wanted to treat employees well. They
were not trying to -- as Jack so eloquently put it on 30 Rock --
"squeeze the sweetest juice out of workers mind grapes."

Even so, I felt a tension between looking out for the company and
looking out for my direct reports. In those cases, I generally found it
easy to prioritize the people who worked for me. This was especially
true since it was many of their first jobs and they hadn't quite figured
out how to advocate for themselves in a workplace.

This materialized in simple ways, like with the woman on my team who was
a dual citizen. The complexities of having multiple passports and
working on projects for the federal government meant she couldn't visit
her parents while she was on the project. It was easy for me to
frequently ask whether that was still ok or whether we should start
looking for another project.

But there were also other cases that were much harder -- where there was
a tension between my role as a mentor for particular members of my team
and my responsibilities as team lead.

For example, someone on the team confidentially shared that she was
considering another project that would give her more exposure to machine
learning. From my perspective as her professional mentor, this was
awesome - that was the work she really wanted to do!

But it was hard for me to keep this information confidential from my
perspective as a team lead, because sitting on it meant less time to
discuss what to do if she left, and more stress for the rest of the team
down the road.

My sense is that exactly what you're stuck between does change depending
on the level of management...but I'm not sure this between-ness ever
really resolves.

### Resource management was particularly hard

I despise the use of the term *resource* to describe a person on a team,
like, "we're going to need to add a resource in Q3" ü§Æ.

But the main resource I managed was the number of people we had and the
roles they filled. I found it really hard to figure out the right number
of people for our team.

Before, I basically just had to figure out how hard to work.

As a manager, I gained the mind-bending ability to add people and make
more time. Simultaneously deciding how much work the team could take on
and how many people we needed required solving an underdetermined system
of equations.

With no clear right answer, I had to rely on my judgement about the
importance of the marginal bit of work and how quickly we could add team
members.

And it wasn't even that simple! Because I was a stuck-between manager, I
couldn't just decide to add more people or even to spend money on other
things like a course or a team dinner -- I had to convince several
layers of management above me that we needed them.

Deciding how hard to push -- and when - and for what roles -- is a
challenge that I don't think ever really ends.

### Mentoring was different

I knew I was a good data scientist with a particularly strong background
in econometrics and statistics, and I had become a very proficient R
programmer. I had done a lot of teaching, which I loved. I figured I had
the mentoring part pf the job in the bag.

Yet again -- wrong.

It turned out that I was good at teaching and instructing. I was good at
clearly explaining technical topics, making them clear and approachable.
That was useful.

But it turned out that an even bigger part of mentoring as a manager was
coaching, rather than teaching. I had to help my direct reports develop
an inspiring vision for their career -- or at least for their
involvement in the current project. It was a heady task -- figuring out
how to convey really high expectations for people without setting short
term goals or deadlines that were unreasonable.

Moreover, it was hard to figure out how to balance people's need for
development -- which means slowing down and taking time to learn -- with
the need to just get stuff done in the quickest way possible. As a
manager, it was my responsibility to figure out when we had to focus on
efficiency and when there were good opportunities for learning.

## I loved management

I've mostly written about how hard management was and how it defied my
expectations.

That's all true.

But it's also the case that I loved my role as a manager. I experienced
so much joy as I watched the connections between the people on my team
got denser, and the team's topology come to resemble a spiderweb much
more so than a wagon wheel with me at the center.

I found, curiously enough, that my joy at seeing what the team
accomplished was inversely proportional to my involvement in it.

Now, having been at RStudio almost 3 years and being back in management,
I look back quite fondly on that hectic, intense, learning-filled first
year.

My hope is that, if you've read this far, you've gotten a nugget or two
that might help your own transition.

So, if you're there -- good luck!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Appendix: Book Recommendations

I've read many, many books on management. I think most are not terribly
useful -- often providing 3 pages of insight in 150 pages of text, or
providing one interesting insight but adding in a lot of other topics
because it seems obligatory.[^5]

[^5]: I am keenly aware of the danger of speaking ill of others writing,
    given my own limitations as a writer. But if it can be useful to
    you, maybe it's worth it.

I'm not going to badmouth any particular books, but I've read most of
the currently-popular management books. If it's not on this list, I've
probably read it and didn't think the marginal information gain was
worth it.

Your mileage may vary.

### Theory

These books strongly shaped the way I think about what management is and
what a manager is doing.

You'll notice that I lean towards older books on theory -- both of these
recommendations were written before I was born! While the computer,
internet, and emote work have changed the practice of management, I
don't think the underlying theory has changed at all.

I strongly believe that the core messages of these books are still fresh
and important, though some of the commentary and assumptions, especially
around gender, have not aged well.

**High Output Management (1983)**

Andy Groves' classic on what management is and how to measure a manager.
Light on practical advice, amazing for forming a mental model of
management. I find myself constantly reaching for quotes from this book
to describe good management.

**Mythical Man Month (1975)**

Fred Brooks' tome on communicating across large groups and software
complexity. Not strictly about management, but deeply impacted the way I
think about the optimal size of working groups and how to help people be
productive.

### Practice

This book helped me figure out what to do every day as a manager,
providing concrete advice on how to do onboarding with people you're
newly managing, conduct 1:1s, and more.

**Radical Candor (2017)**

Kim Scott's book on how to provide direct and meaningful feedback to
direct reports across a wide range of topics and venues. As a new
manager, providing feedback was one of the strangest and hardest things
to learn.
