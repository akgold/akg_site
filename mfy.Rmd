I became a manager for the first time by surprise.

I had been hired to be a "data scientist" for the first time, after
years of doing data science work with different titles. During my first
week, I spoke to my manager only once on the phone, as she was out of
work with a sprained ankle. So I spent the week getting to know the
team, thinking I was coming in as a senior data scientist.

It was only in my second week, as I spoke with my manager more that I
understood that no, I'd been hired to replace her **as** the team's
manager.

During the 18 months I stayed in that role, I learned a ton about
management. I read thousands of pages on management and made some really
big, stupid, mistakes -- including one that literally interrupted my
honeymoon on the beaches of Croatia.

I started this writing project just after I left my management role,
when I moved back into individual contributor work when I came to
RStudio. As of this writing in early March 2021, I find myself in the
early stages of moving back into management at RStudio. Writing
something like this is nerve wracking.

So it's worth saying up front -- I'm not an expert on management. I'm
sure I'll have even more mistakes to write about after the next 18
months of managing. That said, I learned a lot during my first year that
I'm sure will help this time around, and I'm hopeful that others might
find a few of the things I learned useful on their own management
journey.

# Managing The First Year

When I realized I was going to be a manager, I was excited about the
challenge, but also sure I didn't know how to manage, and wasn't really
even sure about how to learn. I understood that leading a data science
team was different from doing data science, and that it would demand I
develop new skills.

Even so, I don't think I could have anticipated how much managing would
stretch me as a professional and a person.

When I started, I wasn't sure how to learn to manage...or even what
management really was. I'd had a few good managers over the years (and
some bad ones), but didn't have a clear mental model of what management
was or how I could get good at it. Certainly nobody was knocking down my
door to mentor me in management skills, and no one was going to hire a
[Trillion Dollar Coach](https://www.trilliondollarcoach.com/) for a
first year junior manager.

So I did what I do best --- I turned to books. I read management books,
biographies of managers, deep dives on companies that seemed to have
figured something great out.

I'm proud of the work the team did during the 18 months I managed them.
We produced a lot of valuable data analysis, and moved a lot of work
into R and Python (yay reproducibility!) that had been done in Excel and
Tableau.

I'm proudest not of any particular deliverable, but of building a team
culture where collaborative problem solving was the very highest value
-- I remember the first time I talked to a direct report who had
consulted a colleague and solved a thorny visualization problem in
Tableau while I was busy doing other things.

As someone who loves data science, that switch was the hardest. As a
manager, my relationship to our data science work was mostly secondhand.
My primary responsibility was not the output, but the team itself.

# What is "Management"?

Good management is a flywheel generator --- it clears obstacles to IC
achievement, creates an environment of safety and growth, and finds and
aggregates resources the team needs.

Numerous resources refer to the roles of the manager with the 3 Ps:

> -   People - are team members happy and engaged?
>
> -   Process - are there mechanisms for the team to be jointly
>     productive?
>
> -   Priorities - is there a shared vision of the work to be done?

I've always found the three Ps a little pat. Yes, they basically
summarize what a manager does...but I think, like so many management
concepts, they don't actually help make anyone good at them.

Also, the way you engage with each of these really differs depending on
the level of manager you are. Being CEO of a 10,000 person company is
really different than managing 5 data scientists. Here's more on my
experience of actually managing a small team.

To me, the job of a junior manager has four distinct parts --- which are
sometimes literally divided into different roles in some workplaces:

> -   **Project manager** Responsibility for collecting project
>     requirements and needs, setting timetables and schedules,
>     assigning tasks, and coordinating and communicating among project
>     stakeholders.
> -   **People manager** Responsibility for the day-to-day performance
>     of subordinates, as well as their long-term career trajectory.
> -   **Resources manager** Responsible for marshaling resources ---
>     most often people and their time to join the team and their
>     projects. Often involving hiring and firing and determining roles.
> -   **Process Manager** Responsible for creating and designing
>     processes to accomplish all the rest. On many teams, this
>     responsibility is spread out among many individuals, some of whom
>     are "managers", some of whom are not.

The question is how being good at your IC work affects the management
tasks ahead of you. The path absolutely is not linear. It is not the
case that being good at your job makes you a good manager.

If you're a highly skilled IC, you'll probably be better than others at
understanding what has to happen in terms of collecting requirements and
setting schedules, and you might be better at mentoring and coaching if
you're doing direct teaching.

Some people believe the opposite to be true --- being too good at IC
work makes you less able to coach people who aren't such naturals. I'm
somewhat skeptical of this claim. I've seen too many people who are both
amazing ICs and teachers and coaches (particularly in martial arts) to
believe this is true.

So why would you want to do this if you really excel at IC work? To me,
the most compelling reason is to gain leverage. Leverage is the ability
to get a lot from a little. In Silicon Valley, they love to throw around
the idea of a 10x developer --- that is a developer so genius and
prolific they are literally 10 times as productive as most others. Let's
take this idea seriously just for a second. Let's say you're a 10x
developer, then you could plausibly replace 10 people with yourself. So
if you manage 11 people, you've now exceeded your own personal output,
and let's be real --- you're not a 10x developer (because they don't
exist).

<aside>

Don't manage 11 people directly. In my experience, the **maximum**
number anyone can reasonably manage directly is somewhere between 7-9.
Fewer is definitely better, but I've seen a 10th direct report crush the
best managers.

</aside>

And now, my most important piece of management advice

> Every manager should do therapy/counseling.

Being a manager will bring out and magnify your insecurities, fears, and
misguided thoughts, and they WILL be visited on your direct reports. I
can't remember where, but I once heard that "organizations magnify the
worst traits of their leaders".\^[I *think* it might've been [this
episode](https://gimletmedia.com/shows/startup/mehw5w/gimlet-23-shadowed-qualities)
of the EXCELLENT Start Up Podcast.] I have seen nothing that makes me
think this is anything less than 100% true.

We all have traits and quirks that are maladaptive in a management role.
Therapy won't *fix* them, but it can increase awareness of them, and
reduce the likelihood you'll unwittingly perpetuate them upon your team.

I do believe there is one big distinguishing feature between people who
excel in a management role and those who struggle --- they have a theory
for why people (usually based on their own experience --- as an example
or counter-example) are good at their job. They might not use that
language --- but they've thought about why they're good at what they do.

This thinking is the raw material of good managing. Turning it into
actual good management requires intentionally, willpower, and a lot of
generosity. What it does not require is any sort of "natural
inclination" --- beyond the desire to do those things.

I should also say there are occasionally amazing leaders who are great
leaders simply because they are so personally astounding and don't do
any of the things I describe here. I am not one of those people and you
probably aren't either. If you are, I'm shocked you started reading
this. Either way, kudos and stop reading --- you do you.

## Mentorship and Coaching

Mentorship and coaching can be a big part of managing, and one of the
most rewarding.

Who am I? There are many different identities that you'll have to manage
between yourself and your direct reports. I always found that I
struggled to convey expectations as high as I have for myself to my
direct reports. I excused slow work and responded kindly to weak excuses
for poor outcomes.

I definitely fell victim to trying to be too much of a *friend* and not
enough of a *coach*. Meanwhile, there is also the role of managing tasks
vs career mentorship. There are many times where the demands of the
immediate task is in conflict with the career wishes of the direct
reports. For example, we had projects that really needed to get done ---
my direct reports wanted to learn the technology we were using, but what
we really needed was for them to just get it done. How do you balance
the time they need to develop new skills with the requirement that they
do the actual work ahead.

(Care personally vs challenge directly)

## Managing New Workers/Interns

Extra challenges

### Whose interests do I represent?

This is a surprisingly difficult question. As a manager, you have two
ways to look --- up, and down. Looking up, you have responsibilities to
the company, your bosses, the rules and regulations (and potentially
laws) that govern the way you work. But you also have to look down to
your responsibilities to the people you manage.

Unlike looking up, where the entities involved are somewhat amorphous
and impersonal, looking down to the people you manage involves their
real concerns. For example, I was on a consulting project that required
a Public Trust --- the lowest level of clearance possible in the federal
clearance process. However, one of my colleagues was as dual citizen,
and was forced to give up her other passport in order to get her Public
Trust. Unfortunately that meant that she couldn't go home to visit her
parents, as her home country required that dual citizens travel there
only with their passport.

These issues become intensely personal.

Be aware of the fact that if you're mentoring younger people in
particular, they probably don't understand the dynamic of a workplace
and that they have to protect themselves from their employer. As a high
school food service employee, I once purchased and brought home a pizza
on which I'd messed up the order, because I thought I had to --- and I
have a severe dairy allergy.

In very real terms of power and privilege, the people who work for you
almost certainly need more protecting from the company than the company
needs protecting from them.

Additionally, people know when your number one priority is looking out
for them and they will respond in kind.

# Meetings

Are really useful. They're your primary tool as a manager.

DIsdain for meetings in is toxic.

They can get out of hand, but just be mindful. Do a meeting Marie Kondo
periodically.
